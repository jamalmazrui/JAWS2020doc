<h1><a name="Top"></a>JAWS Tandem Quick Start Guide</h1>
<p>Use JAWS Tandem&trade; to access another computer running JAWS to provide hands on technical support, write scripts from a distance, or perform remote JAWS training. This feature consists of a controller system, used by support personnel, distributors, dealers, consultants, and trainers, and a target system, which is the customer&rsquo;s JAWS application and computer. </p>
<p>A JAWS Tandem connection serves as an online meeting between two JAWS users.   A meeting can be conducted over the Internet, which is known as a Tandem Center   session, or over a private network, known as a Tandem Direct session. The   primary connection method is through Tandem Center, a gateway server responsible   for creating meeting IDs, verifying proper use of JAWS Tandem, and providing a   path between the two systems. After the session is established, the controller   can manage and run the target system's desktop. </p>
<p>Tandem Center sessions on both the controller and target computers are free   of charge. For Tandem Direct sessions (typically used by corporations within a   network) there is a charge for any computer that acts as a controller such as a   help desk. There is no charge for target computers, such as workstations, in a   Tandem Direct session.</p>
<p>Remember to visit the <a href="#FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Verify the following before you begin:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Internet access</li>
 <li>Windows 7 or later</li>
 <li>If  you are having issues connecting to the Tandem Center, please make sure that  Internet address <font color="#0033CC"><strong>tandem.freedomscientific.com</strong></font> and <font color="#0033CC"><strong>port 12000</strong></font> be given access in the firewall.  If you are in a corporate environment, please contact your IT team with this  information.<!--<li>If you are in a corporate network environment and  have connection issues  with a Tandem Center session, please contact your IT team and request that  Internet address <font color="#0033CC"><strong>tandem.freedomscientific.com</strong></font> and  <font color="#0033CC"><strong>port 12000</strong></font> be given access to your firewall. This is the Internet address and port for Tandem Center.-->

</ul>
<h2><a name="TandemCenter"></a>Starting a JAWS Tandem Center Session</h2>
<p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> The controller user provides the target user with a meeting ID. The ID is automatically generated for the controller during the connection process as described in the following procedure.</p>
<p>To start a JAWS Tandem Center session on a controller computer, do the following:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Press <strong>INSERT+J</strong> to open the JAWS application window.</li>
 <li>Press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu.</li>
 <li>Select JAWS Tandem from this menu, and then select Tandem Center from the next submenu.</li>
 <li>Select Get Access to a computer, which then opens the Get Access to a Computer dialog box.</li>
 <li> Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the Get Access button.<br>
 The Meeting ID Created dialog box opens. An alphanumeric ID appears in the Meeting ID read-only edit field. It is not case sensitive.</li>
 <li>Provide the target user with the meeting ID, and then wait for the connection process to complete on the target system. After successful connection with the target, you have access to  the target system&rsquo;s desktop. Note that once an ID is generated, it is valid for 60 minutes until a connection is made.   If you have not made a connection within this period, you must obtain a new ID   from the Tandem Center.</li>
</ol>
 <p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> Instead of having the target user walk through similar menus, tell the user to press <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong>. This will open the Allow Access to My Computer dialog box, and place focus in the Meeting ID edit box. You can then give the user the meeting ID that was created for you.</p>
 <p>On the target computer, do the following:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Press <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong>. The Allow Access to My Computer dialog box opens.</li>
 <li>Type the meeting ID into the edit box. The ID is not case sensitive.</li>
 <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong>, and then <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the Allow Access button.<br>
   After the controller and target successfully connect, the controller has access to  the target system's desktop.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="RunningSession"></a>Running a Session</h2>
<p> As a controller, you can run the target system using JAWS and braille just as if you are sitting in front of that computer. Use the same JAWS keystrokes and functionality that you are familiar with to control the target system. JAWS keystrokes work no matter which type of keyboard layout is used: Laptop or Desktop.</p>
<h3><a name="TandemKeystrokes"></a>JAWS Tandem Keystrokes</h3>
<p class="Tip-Note-Text"><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> When using the Laptop keyboard layout, substitute <STRONG>CAPS LOCK</STRONG> for <STRONG>INSERT</STRONG> when typing a JAWS Tandem keystroke.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong> &#8211 ends session and can be issued from controller or target systems.<br>
  <strong>Note:</strong> You can also use this keystroke to start JAWS Tandem on a target system.</li>
 <li><strong>INSERT+ALT+TAB</strong> &#8211 
  suspends or resumes a JAWS Tandem session in order to toggle between  target system&rsquo;s desktop and controller system&rsquo;s desktop. Only available on controller system; cannot be used by target system.</li>
 <li><strong>INSERT+CTRL+SHIFT+V</strong> &#8211 toggles video on or off. Video is off by default. When video is on, it lets sighted users  watch JAWS Tandem activity. Only available on controller system; cannot be used by target system.</li>
</ul>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> If JAWS is running with ZoomText or as Fusion, you must always use <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong> to start or end a Tandem session even when using the Laptop keyboard layout.</p>
<h3><a name="RemoteClipboard"></a>Remote Clipboard</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>CTRL+C</strong> keystroke to copy text with formatting from the target system, and then use <strong>CTRL+V</strong> to paste text into a file on the controller system. This is ideal for support personnel who want to copy specific text from a log file on the target system.</p>
<p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> Remote Clipboard will not transfer files.</p>
<h2><a name="Disconnect"></a>Disconnecting a Session</h2>
<p>Press <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong> to terminate a session at any time from either the controller system or the target system. Each system regains control of its own desktop.</p>
<h2><a name="TandemDirect"></a>Tandem Direct Session</h2>
<p>A Tandem  Direct session is used for enterprise networks in a business when two JAWS  users are connected to the same network. All functionality and keystrokes previously  mentioned for a Tandem Center session are applicable for a Tandem Direct  session.</p>
<p>Starting  a Tandem Direct session is slightly different than a Tandem Center session as  outlined in the following list.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine which computer will be the controller and which will be the target.</li>
  <li>The first time you run a Tandem Direct session on a  target system, you must unblock  the program JTTarget so that it can communicate through Windows Firewall. </li>
  <li>The target system always initiates the session, and it must provide its meeting ID and its host name  to the controller.</li>
  <li>By default, the target system listens on port <font color="#0033CC"><strong>3000</strong></font>. If you change the port setting, remember to configure the controller system for the same port.</li>
  <li>The controller can turn on video to view JAWS Tandem activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting a JAWS Tandem Direct Session</h3>
<p>A JAWS  Tandem Direct session is always launched from the target computer. To start, do the  following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Press <strong>INSERT+J</strong> and then <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu in the JAWS application window.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>T</strong> to open the JAWS Tandem submenu, and then <strong>R</strong> to open the Tandem Direct submenu.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>A</strong> to choose Allow Access to my Computer. A dialog box opens with focus  in the Meeting ID edit box. </li>
  <li>Type a value into the Meeting ID edit box. The Meeting ID can be letters, numbers, or a combination of both. The maximum ID length is 64-characters, and it is not case sensitive. You will provide this ID to the controller user. </li>
  <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Host Name or IP Address read-only edit box. Provide the controller user with the host name, for example, ABC-DEF001. </li>
  <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Allow Access button, and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the button.</li>
</ol>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> As a target system, a Windows Security Alert dialog box may appear after pressing the Allow Access button. If this happens, choose the Unblock button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. (If a User Account Control dialog box  opens, choose the Continue button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.) This action adds the JTTarget program to an exceptions list in Windows Firewall on the target system.</p>
  <ol start="7">
	<li>Wait for the controller user to enter the target information. On a successful Tandem Direct connection, JAWS announces Tandem connection open. The controller system now has access to and can operate the target system.</li>
</ol>
<p>To  start a JAWS Tandem Direct session on the controller computer, do the  following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Press <strong>INSERT+J</strong> to open the JAWS application window, and press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>T</strong> to open the JAWS Tandem submenu, and then <strong>R</strong> to open the Tandem Direct submenu.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>G</strong> to select Get Access to a Computer. A dialog box opens, and focus is in the Host Name or IP Address edit box. </li>
  <li>Type the host name, provided to you by the target user, into the edit box.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Meeting ID edit box, and type the ID provided by  the target user. </li>
  <li>Press <strong>TAB </strong>to move to the Enable Video check box. If you are a sighted user and want to watch the JAWS Tandem activity on the target system, select the check box. If you do not need video, clear the check box.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> By default, the Enable Video check box is cleared; however, if you selected the check box in a previous session, JAWS Tandem remembers this setting and uses it for the next session. Also, video can be toggled on or off at any time during a session using <strong>INSERT+CTRL+SHIFT+V</strong>.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Get Access button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the button. After successfully connecting with the target, you now have control of the target system&rsquo;s desktop.  If the connection fails, verify that Windows Firewall is not blocking JTTarget on the target system. Also verify that host name, meeting ID, and port settings match.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Configuring Windows Firewall  for Tandem Direct Sessions</h2>
<p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> The following procedures are only necessary if  JTTarget  is later blocked on the target system.</p>
<p>The target system uses a program named JTTarget. It must be  added to an exceptions list on the target system so that the program can  communicate through Windows Firewall. (It is not necessary to do this on the  controller system.) Windows lets you unblock this program when you first create a Tandem Direct session. Later, if you  block the program by deleting JTTarget from the Windows Firewall exceptions list or by clearing the JTTarget check box in the exceptions list, an error message or a Windows Security Alert will appear the next time the target and controller try to connect.</p>
<h3>Adding JTTarget to the Exceptions List</h3>
<p>If you previously deleted the JTTarget program from the exceptions list in Windows Firewall, use the following steps to add the program: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Windows Control Panel and then select and open Windows Firewall.</li>
  <li>For Windows 10 or Windows 8.1, navigate to and select the Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall link, or for Windows 7, navigate to and select the Allow a program through Windows Firewall link. If a User Account Control dialog box opens, choose the Continue button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the button.</li>
  <li>Select Change Settings and then select the Allow Another App button.</li>
  <li>Choose the Browse button in the Add a Program dialog box, and then type JTTarget.exe in the File name combo of the Browse dialog box. </li>
  <li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong>. The program is added to the Programs list in the Add a Program dialog box. </li>
  <li>Choose OK. JTTarget is added to and selected in the Allowed Programs list.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to save the change and close Windows Firewall. The controller system can now connect to the target system.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Windows Firewall Exception for Tandem Direct </h3>
<p>If you previously cleared the JTTarget check box  in the exceptions list, do the following to select the check box:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Windows Control Panel and then select and open Windows Firewall.</li>
  <li>For Windows 10 or Windows 8.1, navigate to and select the Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall link, or for Windows 7, navigate to and select the Allow a program through Windows Firewall link. If a User Account Control dialog box opens, choose the Continue button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the button.</li>
  <li>Select Change Settings and then select the Allow Another App button.</li>
  <li>In the Allowed Programs list, use the <strong>ARROW </strong>keys to move to JTTarget.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select the check box. </li>
  <li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to save the change and close Windows Firewall. The controller system can now connect to the target system.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Audit"></a>Connection Audit Logging</h2>
<p>JAWS Tandem now maintains a log of session activity using the Windows Event Log service. These events are used to record the beginning and end of a session, the suspension and continuation of a session, and errors triggered before a session starts. The advantage of having such a log is that consultants and trainers now have a record of JAWS Tandem activity which is useful for tracking time for billing purposes and so on. The event log can be set up so that only administrators can delete events. Also, users assigned any privilege level can write events to the event log.</p>

<p class="Tip-Note-Text"><strong>Note:</strong> JAWS Tandem event logging does not record user activity. It only logs session errors and the start, suspension, restart, and end of a session.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To learn more about events, see <a href="#Events">JAWS Tandem Events</a>.</li>
	<li>To learn more about the event properties, see <a href="#Properties">JAWS Tandem Event Properties</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>Event ID 3 &#8211; Tandem session concluded:</strong> An information event showing when a session ended. This can be caused by the target or controller computer closing the session, or by a network error closing the session. It appears in both the controller and target event logs.</li>
	<li><strong>Event ID 4 &#8211; Tandem session suspended:</strong> An information event showing when the controller suspended a session. This is done by toggling between the target system desktop and the controller system desktop using <strong>INSERT+ALT+TAB</strong>. It appears in the target event log.</li>
	<li><strong>Event ID 5 &#8211; Tandem session resumed:</strong> An information event showing when the controller resumed the session. This is done by toggling between the controller system desktop and the target system desktop using <strong>INSERT+ALT+TAB</strong>. It appears in the target event log.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Properties"></a>JAWS Tandem Event Properties</h3>
<p>Event properties provide information about a JAWS Tandem event. The amount of detail given depends on the Event ID type. For example, an Event ID 4 logs only the Meeting ID, whereas an Event ID 3 provides details for all of the following event properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Meeting ID:</strong> The alphanumeric ID that is used to start a session.  For a Tandem Center session, this is the value that is automatically generated for the controller computer. For a Tandem Direct session, this is the value entered in the Meeting ID edit box on the target computer.</li>
	<li><strong>Meeting type:</strong> Indicates if the meeting is a Tandem Center or Tandem Direct session.</li>
	<li><strong>User role:</strong> Indicates if the controller or target computer started or ended the session. It also indicates whether the error occurred on the controller side or the target side of the session.</li>
	<li><strong>Peer machine name – IP address:</strong> The machine name of the other computer in the session. For Tandem Direct sessions, the IP address is also included.</li>
	<li><strong>Peer user name:</strong> The user name associated with the other computer in the session.</li>

<h2><a name="FAQ"></a>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Question: What version of JAWS must the controller and  target system have?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: JAWS 10 or later. An authorized license is  needed if you are going to be a controller.</p><br>


<p><strong>Question: How responsive is the JAWS Tandem session?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: You'll be amazed! It&rsquo;s very  much like Remote Desktop or Citrix.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: Can JAWS Demo or JAWS 40-Minute mode be used with  JAWS Tandem on either the controller or target system?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, you can use JAWS as a  Demo for a target system during Tandem sessions.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: During a Tandem session, which keyboard layout, laptop or desktop, is used?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The  layout used on the controller side of the session is the primary keyboard layout used by both the controller and target systems.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Question: Can a sighted user who is using a mouse on  the controller computer work with the target computer or is it limited to  keyboard use only?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The mouse is also active  when running JAWS Tandem provided that you turn on the video output on the controller  side.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: What are the main uses of this outside of AT  training and tech support?  For example, can it be used to work with web developers for usability testing?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. It can also be used by consultants to  help with scripting and debugging issues from a distance.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: Can JAWS Tandem be used by a JAWS user to remote  into computers of sighted colleagues that don't necessarily use JAWS?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, if the sighted  colleagues install JAWS as a demo on their computers.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: What&nbsp;is the difference between JAWS Tandem&nbsp;and  Remote Desktop, Citrix, or terminal services?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: JAWS Tandem lets you,  the controller, run in the target&rsquo;s user session while the target user is on  the computer at the same time. Remote Desktop/Terminal/Citrix is running on  your own desktop on the remote machine, and no one on the other side can see or  hear it. For support purposes, JAWS Tandem is perfect.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: While in a JAWS Tandem session, can the  controller&nbsp;use the Task Manager on the target computer?</strong></p>
<p> Answer:&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;To launch  Task Manager on the target  side, you must use the keystroke <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ESCAPE</strong>, or press <strong>WINDOWS Key+R</strong> to open the Run dialog box, and then type taskmgr and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.&nbsp;Note  that if you try to use <strong>CTRL+ALT+DELETE</strong> to open the Task  Manager, this command will be executed on the controller's machine.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  From the controller system, can I hear the target system&rsquo;s audio?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. During a JAWS Tandem session, events that generate sounds on the target   system, such as a Windows program error, entry and exit of Auto Forms Mode, or   other JAWS sounds associated with the Speech and Sounds Manager, can be heard on   the controller system. This means that when an event occurs on the target   system, a notification is sent to the controller system so that the controller   computer plays the same or a similar WAV file. This is very helpful to support   personnel and trainers running the JAWS Tandem session.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Question:  Can I change my synthesizer during a session?</strong> </p>
<p>Answer: No. After a session is established, you can  only change the pitch or volume of your synthesizer.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: Can my English United States  (ENU) computer use JAWS Tandem to connect to an English United Kingdom  (ENG) or Australian (ENA) computer?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Systems with different minor languages  (dialects) will work in JAWS Tandem.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  Can my English computer use JAWS Tandem to connect to a computer with a different  major language such as French or Spanish?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No. You would first need to switch one of the computers  to match the others&rsquo; major language before starting the JAWS Tandem session.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  Can a controller temporarily turn off any JAWS user settings on the target  computer, in order to troubleshoot a problem that the target computer is  having?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Use the Manage Application Settings  dialog box located in the Options menu of the JAWS application window. In this  dialog, you can choose to disable all settings, default settings, or selective  applications without having to restart JAWS. A restart would end the JAWS  Tandem session. This is a great way to troubleshoot a problem by ruling out any  user modifications or third party scripts.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: If either the controller or target  computer needs to be restarted, what will happen to the JAWS Tandem session?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: You would need to start a JAWS Tandem  session again with a new meeting ID after the computer restarts. It is  suggested that the controller or target end the JAWS Tandem session with <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong> before rebooting the  computer.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  How many computers can join a JAWS Tandem session?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: There can only be two. One controller and  one target.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  If you are using Skype to talk between two different computers, can you  also use JAWS Tandem without ending the Skype call?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, this can be very useful as well. The  controller can explain what is being done and the target user can ask questions  over Skype during the entire session consequently avoiding a phone call.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  What if either computer receives a Skype call during a JAWS Tandem Session? Can  it be answered?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: If the call is on the target computer, then  either the target user, or controller for that matter, can answer. If the call  is on the controller side, then the controller can answer it by toggling back  to his or her own desktop by using <strong>INSERT+ALT+TAB</strong> without having to end the JAWS Tandem session.</p><br>

<p><STRONG>Question: Can I run JAWS and MAGic simultaneously with JAWS   Tandem?</STRONG></p>
<p>Answer: Not at this time. If you want to   run JAWS Tandem, exit MAGic first before starting a JAWS Tandem session. You can   restart MAGic after you close the session.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Question: What is the role of the Tandem Center?</strong></p>
<p> Answer: The&nbsp;Tandem Center allows two arbitrary JAWS users anywhere on  the Internet to connect to each other. The Tandem Center gets  data from one  user and passes it to the other user.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question:  Who runs the Tandem   Center?</strong> </p>
<p>Answer: The Tandem Center  is hosted by Freedom Scientific.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Question: How does JAWS Tandem communication work?</strong></p>
        <p>Answer: JAWS Tandem uses  a proprietary protocol to establish a connection and transport data between two computers. To achieve security, it uses Diffie Hellman Key exchange (DH 1024) for asymmetric key exchange  and RC4 cipher for the symmetric  part. It uses Open SSL 1.0.2n to provide the actual implementation of the key exchange and cipher algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Does Freedom Scientific know about what I am doing if all data travels through  the Tandem Center?</strong></p>
<p> Answer: Freedom  Scientific does not record the contents of any session.  The session  infrastructure is set up so that once a session begins; the data is encrypted  so that the Tandem   Center server cannot  decipher the information.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Question:  Can the target user disconnect the session if they do not like the controller  user&rsquo;s actions?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Any  user can disconnect at any time by pressing <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong>.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: My Firewall is blocking the connection to the Tandem Center. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Tandem Center runs at a well-known Internet address and port. The Tandem Center address is <font color="#0033CC"><strong>tandem.freedomscientific.com</strong></font>. The port is <font color="#0033CC"><strong>12000</strong></font>. If Tandem Center is being blocked, configure your firewall to allow access to this address and port.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: For a Tandem Direct session, what port does the target system listen to for a connection to the controller system? Can I change the port?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: For a Tandem Direct session, the target system listens on port <font color="#0033CC"><strong>3000</strong></font> by default. If you need to change the port setting, choose the Options button in the Allow Access to my Computer dialog box, and type a new port number in the Port edit box. Remember to tell the user on the controller side so that JAWS Tandem on the controller system can be configured for the same port.

<p><strong>Question: I use the DECtalk hardware  synthesizer. My friend wants to connect to me and help me configure e-mail.   He does not have DECtalk and uses Vocalizer Expressive. Can we have a JAWS  Tandem session?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, JAWS Tandem will detect that you and your friend have different  synthesizers. It will offer to switch both of you to Eloquence for the length  of the sessions.  You both will connect and work for the length of the  session using Eloquence.  After the JAWS Tandem session ends, both you and  your friend will go back to your synthesizers automatically.</p><br>

<p><strong>Question: My Tandem Direct  connection fails and JAWS announces the following message:  A connection attempt failed because the  connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or the  established connection failed because the connected host has failed to respond. What happened? </strong></p>
<p>Answer:  On the target system, you must add an  exception to the JTTarget program in the Windows Firewall dialog box. To do  this, open Control Panel and choose Windows Firewall. Next, press <strong>CTRL+TAB </strong>to switch to the Exceptions  page. In the Programs and Services list, use the <strong>ARROW </strong>keys to move to JTTarget. Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select the check box. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to save the change and close Windows Firewall.  Make a Tandem Direct connection again.  If this still does not work, restart JAWS and  try to connect again.</p>
