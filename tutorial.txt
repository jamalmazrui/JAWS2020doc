About JAWS Cursors

Navigating through Windows with JAWS is accomplished with cursors. These cursors determine the focus of JAWS speech and are often directly linked with Windows cursors.

The PC Cursor - Follows Keystrokes

This cursor is linked to the keyboard functions of Windows and applications. This is the cursor that is used when typing information, moving through options in dialog boxes, and selecting options or icons. As you type information, the PC Cursor follows along with each key you press. If you are making a selection in a menu or dialog box, the PC Cursor highlights the currently selected object. The PC Cursor is activated by default when JAWS starts. If you are using a different cursor, pressing NUM PAD PLUS returns you to the PC Cursor.

The JAWS Cursor - Follows Mouse Pointer

The JAWS Cursor is linked to mouse pointer functions in Windows and other applications. It is used to read information the PC Cursor cannot read, such as toolbar information. The mouse follows along with the JAWS Cursor when it is moved, and you therefore have access to information in an application window that is beyond the scope of the PC Cursor. To activate the JAWS Cursor, press NUM PAD MINUS.

The Invisible Cursor - Explore Without Moving Focus

The Invisible Cursor allows you to move around the screen without changing the position of the PC Cursor or mouse pointer. You can use this cursor to read text and access options that you cannot move to with the PC Cursor. You can also use the Invisible Cursor to provide a quick overview of the information currently available on the screen. To activate the Invisible Cursor, press NUM PAD MINUS twice quickly.

The Touch Cursor - Object Navigation

The Touch Cursor enables you to navigate the Windows environment using a touch screen, found on many tablet computers running Windows 8 or later. To control JAWS from a touch screen, you will use one or more fingers to perform various gestures directly on the screen, such as tapping, flicking, and swiping. When activated from the keyboard, you can use keystrokes to simulate touch screen gestures to move through the objects in an application to access information that is not readily accessible using the JAWS or PC Cursor.

The Touch Cursor is always available when navigating using a touch screen. To activate the Touch Cursor from the keyboard, press SHIFT+NUM PAD PLUS.

The Virtual PC Cursor - HTML Environment

The virtual PC Cursor mimics the functions of the PC Cursor, but is activated by default when entering an HTML document, such as a web page on the Internet. The virtual PC Cursor speaks the number of elements on the page when it first opens. For instance, the number of links, headings, and regions. You can use the ARROW keys to navigate and read the document, or use Navigation Quick Keys to move to specific elements, such as paragraphs, tables, or headings. JAWS also reads graphics labeled by alt tags in the HTML code.

Voice Settings

JAWS allows you to customize the voices used for speech so you don’t get them confused. You can assign different voices for cursor messages, the keyboard voice that you hear when you type, and even upper case characters.

To open voice settings, do the following:

1.    Press INSERT+J to make the JAWS window active.

2.    Press ALT+O to choose the Options menu.

3.    Press V and then press ENTER to open the Voice Adjustment dialog box. From here you can choose an existing voice profile or a factory voice profile template and change various settings such as language, voice, speech rate, announced punctuation, and more to configure JAWS speech to your liking.

4.    After making changes, save the voice profile and exit the Voice Adjustment dialog box.

To select a voice profile, do the following:

1.    Press INSERT+CTRL+S to open the Select a Voice Profile dialog box.

2.    Use the Default combo box to select a voice profile that will be used globally by JAWS.

3.    Use the For combo box to select a voice profile to use with the application that is currently open. If you select Default, JAWS will use the voice profile currently selected in the Default combo box.
