The zip archive, JAWS2020doc.zip, contains HTML and plain text versions of all official documentation for the JAWS screen reader, version 2020, published by Vispero and available from the following web page:

https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/

Help files in .chm, .doc, .pdf, and .rtf formats were converted to .htm format by automated tools (omitting images).  Tutorials split into multiple .htm files were combined into a single one.  Resulting .htm and .html files were converted to .txt.

The HTML files may be read with any web browser, and the plain text files may be read with almost any file viewer.
