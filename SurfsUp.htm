<h2 id="get">Getting Started With Surf's Up</h2>
<p>You can use Surf's Up with the web browser of your choice, however, many of our exercises and examples regularly refer to the Google Chrome™ web browser. Chrome is one of the most popular browsers today as it is frequently updated to support the latest web standards. If you choose to use Chrome and it is already installed on your computer, you can launch it by selecting the Google Chrome shortcut on the Desktop.</p>
<h3 id="install-google-chrome">Install Google Chrome</h3>
<p>If you would like to install Chrome, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox™, go to the <a href="https://www.chrome.com">Chrome download page</a>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>B</strong> to move to the Download Chrome button and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>B</strong> to move to the Accept and Install button and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. Chrome will automatically download and install.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="install-mozilla-firefox">Install Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>If you would like to install Mozilla™ Firefox™, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From a web browser such as Google Chrome, go to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox download page</a>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to open the JAWS list of links, and then choose the Download Now or Download in another language link.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+F6</strong> to move to the Installer button on the bottom left side of the page, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to start the install.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="install-microsoft-edge">Install Microsoft Edge</h3>
<p>Microsoft's new Edge web browser based on Chromium, which works very well with JAWS, is slowly rolling out to Windows 10 devices over automatic updates. While it should be available to all users in the coming months, you can skip the wait and install it now by doing the following:</p>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h3 id="jaws-help-keystrokes">JAWS Help Keystrokes</h3>
<p>JAWS provides context-sensitive help for many different elements you might encounter in web pages. To read help information for the current web page, or for an element within a web page, press <strong>INSERT+F1</strong>. For general help with whatever browser you are using press <strong>INSERT+F1</strong> twice quickly while the browser is the active window. For Hot Key Help for browsers (or other apps) with JAWS press <strong>INSERT+H</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="tabbed-browsing">Tabbed Browsing</h3>
<p>Many of the exercise pages and keystroke command pages in <em>Surf's Up</em> either open in new browser windows or in new browser tabs, depending on how your version of any browser is set up. You can press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to move between the different open windows, or <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> to move between different tab pages in the current browser session. Also remember to close the open windows by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong> when you are finished with them or close a single tab page by pressing <strong>CTRL+F4</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-jaws-key">The JAWS Key</h3>
<p>You will notice occasional references to the JAWS key when using JAWS. This key is used by JAWS in combination with other keys on the keyboard to perform various actions. For example, the <strong>JAWS Key+T</strong> reads the title of the current document while <strong>JAWS Key+F7</strong> opens a list of links in a web page.</p>
<p>The default JAWS keys are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAWS desktop layout uses the <strong>INSERT</strong> key</li>
<li>JAWS laptop layout uses the <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> key</li>
</ul>
<p>The JAWS key can be changed from the <strong>INSERT</strong> key to the <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> or <strong>SCROLL LOCK</strong> key. This can be done by opening the list of JAWS managers (<strong>INSERT+F2</strong>) and choosing Settings Center. The JAWS Key for either desktop or laptop layout is found in the Keyboard branch of the tree view. This must be changed in the default settings which can be selected by pressing <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="access-keys-to-navigate-by-page-forward-or-backward-in-surfs-up">Access Keys to Navigate by Page Forward or Backward in Surf's Up</h3>
<p>At the bottom of each page in Surf's Up are links to the next or prior page. Use the following Access Keys to navigate forward or backward one page at a time in Surf's Up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALT+N</strong> activates the Next page link</li>
<li><strong>ALT+B</strong> activates the Back link to move to the prior page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Firefox adds the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key to the key combination for access keys on web pages. If you use Firefox, press <strong>ALT+SHIFT+N</strong> or <strong>ALT+SHIFT+B</strong> to move to the next or prior pages with the access keys in Surf's Up.</p>
<h3 id="using-surfs-up-on-a-local-computer">Using Surf's Up on a Local Computer</h3>
<p>Finally, you can download a ZIP file containing all Surf's Up pages and files. This allows you to install the whole Surf's Up training website on a local computer. For example, if you are an instructor, you could store it on a thumb drive for use if you ever encounter the need to do web-based training where there is no Internet connection.</p>

<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="introduction-to-browsing-the-web">Introduction to Browsing the Web</h1>
<p>Web browsers are programs that allow you to access web pages on the Internet, read HTML (hypertext markup language) documents on your computer, or view your local intranet site. These browsers don't just display information. They also help you find information using search engines, purchase products online using various online shopping sites, interact with other people using social media services, use web-based editing applications to create documents, and much more.</p>
<p>JAWS works best with the latest versions of Google Chrome™, Mozilla® Firefox®, the Microsoft® Edge® Chromium browser (initially released in early 2020), and Internet Explorer 11®. JAWS provides the same powerful features for each supported browser, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>When browsing the web, JAWS gives you quick access to the information you need, and provides detailed information about the structure and organization of web pages. Tables, lists, headings, and alternate text for images are all announced. The information comes right from the HTML used to create the page. HTML is designed with accessibility in mind, and JAWS supports more of the built-in HTML accessibility features than any other screen reader.</p>
<p>JAWS uses the Virtual Cursor on web pages, letting you read as you would in a word processing document. The Virtual Cursor is also available in other applications, such as HTML based help systems, HTML based e-mails in Outlook, and in PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Many of the features discussed within these topics are also available wherever the Virtual Cursor is used.</p>
<p>When you open the browser, your home page opens. If you don't have a home page specified, you can select a web page from your Favorites menu, or press <strong>ALT+D</strong> to move to the Address Bar and type in the address of a page. Once a page is selected, it is loaded and JAWS announces the page title along with the number of links, headings, and regions. Then, JAWS begins reading the text on the screen from top to bottom. To move through the page, use <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>, <strong>PAGE UP</strong>, and <strong>PAGE DOWN</strong> as you would in a word processing document. The JAWS commands to Read By Word, Line, Sentence, and Paragraph work normally.</p>
<p>If you are using Fusion, JAWS will not automatically begin reading the page after announcing the title followed by the number of elements. This prevents focus from being bumped back up to the top of the page if you are a low vision user attempting to navigate with the mouse. To change this setting, open JAWS Settings Center and select "Document and Web Pages Automatically Read."</p>
<p>As you navigate a page, JAWS says, "link," when it encounters a link to another document or portion of the page. To follow a link, press <strong>ENTER</strong> while positioned on the link.</p>
<p>To go back to the previous page, press <strong>ALT+LEFT ARROW</strong> or <strong>BACKSPACE</strong>. To move forward one page after you have moved back, press <strong>ALT+RIGHT ARROW</strong>.</p>

<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="web-page-elements">Web Page Elements</h1>
<p>Elements are used to create the structure of a web page and are used to present information in various ways. JAWS interacts with these elements to provide the information you need to access the page contents. Some of the most common web page elements you will encounter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Paragraphs</li>
<li>Headings</li>
<li>Numbered and bulleted lists</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Regions</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Form controls including radio buttons, edit fields, check boxes, combo boxes, list boxes, and buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>JAWS provides easy to use and remember commands called Navigation Quick Keys for quickly moving to various elements on a web page. Press a single letter on your keyboard and move right to an item. For example, you can press <strong>T</strong> for tables, <strong>F</strong> for form controls, <strong>V</strong> for visited links, <strong>H</strong> for headings, and so on. Add <strong>SHIFT</strong> to any navigation quick key to move to the previous element of that type.</p>
<p>For instance, a sighted user can visually scan through headings on a page until they find the one they want and then focus in on the text in that section. Similarly, using JAWS, you can press <strong>H</strong> to quickly move through all of the headings on a page until you locate the one you want and then start reading with the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-lists-of-elements">Viewing Lists of Elements</h2>
<p>JAWS can look at a web page and compile lists of paragraphs, links, headings, form fields, and other elements so you can quickly find what you need and move to information. Press <strong>INSERT+F3</strong> to open the Virtual HTML Features dialog box. This dialog box allows you to choose from a variety of lists containing information about different types of elements on the current page. Select an item and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to view a list of all those elements.</p>
<p>You can also use the following commands to quickly display lists of the following important HTML elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form Fields - Press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong></li>
<li>Headings - Press <strong>INSERT+F6</strong></li>
<li>Links - Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you hold down <strong>CTRL+INSERT</strong> and press one of several Navigation Quick Keys, JAWS displays a list of those elements on the current page. For example, to display a list of check boxes on the current page, press <strong>CTRL+INSERT+X</strong>.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to move through the lists and select items. Alternatively, press the first letter of an item to move right to it. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to the selected item's location on the page.</p>

<p>Navigation Quick Keys make it faster and easier to move around on a Web page and anywhere else the Virtual Cursor is active. These commands are all assigned to keys on the main part of the keyboard, and are easy to remember and use. Press <strong>CTRL+F4</strong> to close this page when you are finished reading it.</p>
<h2 id="html-navigation-quick-keys-for-say-all">HTML Navigation Quick Keys for Say All</h2>
<p>Many of the JAWS navigation quick keys are also available while using Say All on a Web page. The commands to move by heading, paragraph, form control, table, list, same or different element, next element, and to move to non-link text all work while you are using the Say All command.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> You can use the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key in combination with many of the keystrokes in the table below to move to the previous unit or element.</p>

<p>Jim's Cafe was founded in 1946 by Jim Smith. At that time, Jim was a sergeant in the United States Army, who had just finished a tour of duty in Europe. Ready to begin civilian life, he settled down in the sleepy town of Innisport with his wife, Charlotte, and their son, James Jr.</p>
<p>Taking a second mortgage out on his home, he purchased a run-down book shop in downtown Innisport and set about realizing his dream of owning a successful restaurant. The first few years were lean, but as the town of Innisport grew and prospered, Jim's Cafe became a favorite place for lunch breaks and Saturday night dinners.</p>
<p>For over 60 years, Jim's Cafe has been renowned for excellent service, a dazzling variety of dishes and appetizers, and scenic location. Use the links below to read more:</p>

<h2 id="reputation-for-quality-service">Reputation for Quality Service</h2>
<p>Jim's Cafe was an immediate success. The little cafe quickly garnered a reputation for friendly service and delicious food. Jim worked in the kitchen, while his wife and sister-in-law took care of the customers. Early on, the two sisters created a code which they decided to use to ensure that their reputation stayed strong. That code, which is still honored by the staff of Jim's Cafe today, reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always have a friendly smile and a kind word to say.</li>
<li>Service doesn't end when the food is served.</li>
<li>If it isn't done just right, send it back!</li>
</ul>

<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="navigating-web-pages">Navigating Web Pages</h1>
<p>JAWS makes reading web pages easy. When you visit a page JAWS immediately begins reading the page from the top down. In this section, you will learn about <a href="Quick_Keys.htm">Navigation Quick Keys</a>, reading text, and navigating headings, lists, links, and images.</p>
<h2 id="reading-text">Reading Text</h2>
<p>JAWS uses the Virtual Cursor to move through HTML pages, enabling JAWS users to read and select text and move to different elements on the page. The Virtual Cursor is invisible to sighted users, however, JAWS highlights text as it is read so a sighted user such as a teacher, parent, tester, or developer can easily follow the text visually.</p>
<p>The commands used to read web pages are the same as the commands used to read text in any other type of document. You can also select and copy text on web pages. The sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> demonstrates the layout and content of a typical web page on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> To see a complete list of commands that you can use to read text in documents, refer to the <a href="Reading_Commands.htm">JAWS Reading Commands</a> table. If you are not yet familiar with JAWS table reading commands just press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through and read the commands in the table.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip</strong>: To begin reading anywhere on a web page beneath the mouse cursor with JAWS, move the mouse pointer over the text you want to read. Then press the keystroke <strong>INSERT+NUM PAD PLUS</strong>. This is the keystroke to route the virtual cursor to the mouse cursor. Then use normal reading keys.</p>
<p>To practice reading text on the Internet with JAWS, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to display a list of links on this page.</li>
<li>Make sure the link <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> is selected and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. This opens the sample page in a new browser window. You can hold down <strong>CTRL</strong> and press <strong>TAB</strong> to switch back to this window and refer to these instructions. JAWS remembers where you are on the page, so you won't lose your place. If the page opens in a completely new window just use <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to switch between windows.</li>
<li>When the page loads, JAWS begins reading it. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page. Then press <strong>P</strong> three times to move to the second paragraph on the page. The first press of the letter <strong>P</strong> on this page moves to the graphic logo and heading level one at the top of the page for Jim's Cafe.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="Reading_Commands.htm">standard JAWS reading commands</a> to read the text on the page. Any command that you can use to read text or Word documents can be used when reading web pages.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+P</strong> until you return to the first paragraph on the page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> The letter <strong>P</strong> is a Navigation Quick Key that lets you move by paragraph through the page. There are other Navigation Quick Keys that let you move through all the headings, links, images, and other elements on the page. If you hold <strong>SHIFT</strong> when you press one of these keys, JAWS moves to the previous element. For example, pressing <strong>SHIFT+P</strong> moves you to the previous paragraph. To read more about them choose the link <a href="Quick_Keys.htm">Navigation Quick Keys</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>A hyperlink (or "link" for short) is text that performs some action when you click it or select it and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. You can move through all the links on the page by pressing the <strong>TAB</strong> key. To see how JAWS helps you navigate links, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>U</strong> to move to the first unvisited link on the page. An unvisited link is one that leads to a page or location that you have not visited.</li>
<li>Press <strong>V</strong> to move to the next visited link on the page. A visited link is one that you have previously activated or one that leads to a page you have visited recently.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to display a list of all links on the page. Use the arrow keys to select "Innisport Hotel" and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. Read the message that appears and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the dialog box does not read automatically just press the JAWS keystroke to read the current window, <strong>INSERT+B</strong>.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> again. Select "Reputation for Quality Service" and press <strong>ALT+M</strong> to move to this link. JAWS says, "This page link," to indicate that this hyperlink will take you to another location on the current page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> The link "Reputation for Quality Service" is the start of a list of four links. Many web pages use clusters of links like this to consolidate page navigation in a single spot. If you wanted to continue reading down the page without using any of these links, you could skip over them by pressing <strong>N</strong>. The Navigation Quick Key <strong>N</strong> moves you to the next block of text that is not a link.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> again. Select "Send us an e-mail message" and press <strong>ALT+M</strong> to move to this link. JAWS says, "Send mail link," to indicate that this link allows you to send a message to an e-mail address using your default mail program.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In addition to same page and e-mail links, another special type of link you may encounter is called an FTP link. When you move to these links, JAWS says, "FTP link." Activating an FTP link opens an FTP session that usually allows you to download files. For example, the following is an actual FTP link: <a href="ftp://ftp.freedomscientific.com/users/hj/winboard/WinBoard.exe">Download an Accessible Chess Game</a>. When you activate this link, the browser begins downloading a file containing an accessible chess game called WinBoard from the FTP site.</p>
<h3 id="skip-to-main-content-links">Skip to Main Content Links</h3>
<p>Some web pages have special links with names like "Skip to Main Content" or "Skip Navigation." These same page links allow you to quickly jump past site navigation tools, such as menus, navigation bars, and so on and go directly to the important information on the page. These types of links usually appear at the beginning of the page and are often invisible to sighted users.</p>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>Web pages often contain bulleted (unordered) and numbered (ordered) lists that provide information. The procedures on this page are examples of lists. To see how JAWS navigates lists, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>L</strong> to move to the first list on the page. This is a bulleted list that contains three items.</li>
<li>Press <strong>I</strong> to read the first item on the list. You can continue using either <strong>I</strong> or the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to read through the rest of the list. To move back through the list, use <strong>SHIFT+I</strong> or the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> key.</li>
<li>Press <strong>L</strong> to move to the next list. This is a numbered list with four steps that explain how to locate the restaurant. Review the steps in this list with <strong>I</strong> or the arrow keys.</li>
<li>Press <strong>I</strong> until you move to step three.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the nested list within step three. This nested list is an unordered list of three bulleted items. A nested list is a list of items that is contained within a larger list. Another example of a nested list would be an outline. JAWS announces the level of nested lists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lists may be arranged differently depending on their purpose. Web page authors may interrupt a list with a paragraph, quote, image, or similar element. If this is the case, the next list on the page usually begins where the previous list ended. For example, if a procedure is interrupted during step three by an image, the next list on the page might begin with step four.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> You can display all lists on the page by pressing <strong>INSERT+CTRL+L</strong>. You can then select a list and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to it. Note that the list items within each list are displayed in one single horizontal line per list within this dialog box, so you hear a lot of information when using this particular keystroke.</p>
<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>
<p>Web page authors use headings to divide a document into sections. Level 1 is the highest level of heading. Level 2 headings are subsections of level 1 headings. Level 3 headings are subsections of level 2 headings and so on.</p>
<h3 id="navigation-quick-keys-for-headings">Navigation Quick Keys for Headings</h3>
<p>To see how JAWS allows you to navigate headings, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>H</strong> to move to and read the first heading on the page. JAWS says, "Jim's Cafe at Innisport." This is the only level one heading on the page. Level one headings often indicate the topic or subject of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>H</strong> again until you move to the level three heading, "Poultry." Press <strong>P</strong> to read the text below this heading.</li>
<li>Press <strong>H</strong> a few more times. You eventually reach the bottom of the page. JAWS says, "Wrapping to top," when there are no more headings. JAWS then moves you back to the first heading at the top of the document.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> Don't forget that you can add <strong>SHIFT</strong> to navigation quick keys to move backward through the page. For example, press <strong>SHIFT+H</strong> to move to the previous heading.</p>
<p>When you reach the top of the page by using the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key in combination with navigation quick keys to move backwards through the page, JAWS announces, "Wrapping to bottom," and starts over again from the bottom of the document.</p>
<p>You can press <strong>ALT+INSERT+HOME</strong> to move to the first heading on the page, and press <strong>ALT+INSERT+END</strong> to move to the last heading on the page.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-numbers-row-to-jump-to-a-specific-heading-level">Using the Numbers Row to Jump to a Specific Heading Level</h3>
<p>You can move to headings of a certain level by pressing a number between <strong>1</strong> and <strong>6</strong> as long as one or more headings of the specified level exist on the web page. To see how this works, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>1</strong> to move to and read the first heading on the page. JAWS says, "Jim's Cafe at Innisport." Press <strong>1</strong></li>
<li>Since we've been to this page before, we know that all of the menu items are under level three headings, so we want to quickly jump to these without looking at anything else on the page. Press <strong>3</strong> to move to the first level three heading which is "Poultry."</li>
<li>Did you notice that JAWS first announced the level two heading "Dishes and Appetizers" followed by the level three heading "Poultry?" There is a prior section with a level two heading called "Reputation for Quality Service" which does not contain any level three headings. Since JAWS completely skips over a section of the web page in order to reach the first level three heading, JAWS announces the higher precedence heading, in this case "Dishes and Appetizers," before announcing the "Poultry" heading so you know you have moved into a new section.</li>
<li>Continue pressing the number <strong>3</strong> a few times. Did you hear JAWS announce "no next heading at level three in this section" after reaching the level three heading for Seafood?</li>
<li>Now try pressing the number <strong>3</strong> with the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key to move backwards by level three headings. Did you hear JAWS announce "no prior heading at level three in this section" after reaching the level three heading for Poultry? This gives you a good idea of how the different headings relate to each other.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> You can also choose to have JAWS play a sound to indicate when you move into a new section or you can restrict heading navigation using the numbers row to the current section. For example, if you attempt to move to a level three heading, but the very next heading is a level two, JAWS stops at the level two heading and will not pass it even though there may be level three headings in the next section.</p>
<p>To configure how JAWS navigates headings when using the numbers <strong>1</strong> through <strong>6</strong>, open Settings Center, type "heading" into the Search edit box, select the "Heading Navigation Using 1-6" option, and then press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose the setting you want. Alternatively, open Quick Settings (<strong>INSERT+V</strong>) from your browser and configure the "Heading Navigation" setting.</p>
<h3 id="the-jaws-list-of-headings">The JAWS List of Headings</h3>
<p>JAWS also has a list of headings that allows you to navigate by headings on a web page. You can sort this list by tab order or alphabetically. You can also view only headings of a specified level. To explore the options in this dialog box, do the following:</p>
<p>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</p>
<p>Press <strong>INSERT+F6</strong> to display a list of headings on this page. Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the list and read the headings. If you select a heading and press <strong>ENTER</strong>, the list closes and you move directly to that heading in the document.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>TAB</strong> key to explore the Heading List dialog box in more detail. Each option is described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Move To Heading</strong> button - Use this button to move to the location of the currently selected heading.</li>
<li><strong>Cancel</strong> button - Closes the list of headings without changing your location on the page.</li>
<li><strong>Sort Headings</strong> radio buttons - Select one of these radio buttons to specify whether you want to sort the headings in this list alphabetically or by tab order.</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> radio buttons - Select one of these radio buttons to include only headings of the specified level in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you are back in the actual list of headings. Press <strong>ALT+1</strong> on the numbers row and read the current line by pressing <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong>. You should hear that there is only one item now in the list, a level one heading.</p>
<p>Press <strong>ALT+2</strong> on the numbers row and read the current line by pressing <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong>. You should hear that there are now four items displayed in the list, all level two headings. In the list of headings, you can filter out all headings except the specific level you are looking for by pressing <strong>ALT</strong> and any number from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>6</strong>. To view all headings again, press <strong>ALT+L</strong>.</p>
<p>Press <strong>ESC</strong> for now to close the list of headings.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Use the list of headings in JAWS whenever you first go to a web page to get an overview of how the page is structured.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>Most web pages use images to enhance their appearance, provide information, or assist with navigation. To see how JAWS handles images, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>G</strong> until you move to the level one heading, "Jim's Cafe at Innisport." You may not have noticed it earlier, but the level one heading in this document is actually an image.</li>
<li>JAWS cannot read graphic text. The text you are hearing for this image is called alternate text. Web page authors use alternate text to describe images.</li>
<li>Press <strong>G</strong> to move to the next image, which is a graphical link. The alternate text tells you that this is a map. On an actual page, a person might be able to click this image to open another page where the image is shown in larger size.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the graphical link. Read the message that appears and then press <strong>ALT+F4</strong>. If the dialog box does not read automatically just press the JAWS keystroke to read the current window, <strong>INSERT+B</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+G</strong> to display a list of all images on the page. This keystroke only works if you have JAWS running.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> When you press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+G</strong> notice that the item highlighted in the list is the one that is closest to where you are currently reading on the page.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Select "FS-SiteFactory Logo," which is the next image on the page, and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to it. There is no alternate text for this image, so JAWS reads the title attribute instead.</li>
<li>Press <strong>G</strong> to move to the next image. It is an image of the Freedom Scientific logo. Notice the difference between the prior image and this one. This one is more than just an image; it is also a graphic <em>link</em>. Additionally, this link has an alt attribute instead of a title attribute describing the image. The link takes you to the Freedom Scientific home page. If you want to activate the link, press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>G</strong> again to move to the last image on the page. This image has no alternate text or title. However, this image is a link to another page. For images like this one, JAWS announces the image's file name and tells you that the image is a link.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tab-pages-in-web-browsers">Tab Pages in Web Browsers</h2>
<p>You can have several different tab pages open at once in web browsers. You can switch between the multiple tabbed pages by pressing <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong>. Use the link here for a list of <a href="TabbedBrowsingKeystrokes.htm">keystrokes for tabbed browsing</a>. If you are using a web browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and you want a more complete list of the keystrokes, how would you find out what keystrokes are available to you? You can press <strong>INSERT+F1</strong> twice quickly in any application to find the JAWS help for that application. Also, within different applications try pressing <strong>INSERT+H</strong> to open JAWS Hotkey Help for that application.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> You can use <strong>PlaceMarkers</strong> with JAWS to mark spots on web pages so that you can find them again quickly. PlaceMarkers are discussed in more detail later, but they are very easy to use. Here's how to get started with PlaceMarkers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before moving on, let's put a PlaceMarker right here. You can move right back to any spot on any web page using JAWS PlaceMarkers. Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+K</strong>. The PlaceMarker dialog box appears. Focus is on the Add button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Add button. JAWS gathers the text from where you are on the page and puts it into an edit box. You can change this by typing over it or editing it, but for now, just leave it alone and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close the PlaceMarker dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to go to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Now press the navigation quick key <strong>K</strong> to move back to where you just put the PlaceMarker on this page. See how that works? Feel free to put PlaceMarkers anywhere on the Surf's Up pages as you begin using them. It makes it very easy to get back to the exact spot you want to go to.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Try the following exercise for tabbed browsing now.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next link on this page, followed by <strong>CTRL+ENTER</strong>. The Jim's Cafe page loads in a new tab page in the background. Navigating Web pages is still running on a tab page in the foreground. <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a></li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> a few times to move between the two pages.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> to move back to the Jim's Cafe page and spend a minute reading through it. When you are finished, press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> to move back to the Navigating page.</li>
<li>Next, if you are using Firefox or Internet Explorer, press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> but don't go beyond that. If you only had one tab page open <strong>ALT+F4</strong> would close that page and the whole browser window. Instead, since there are multiple tab pages open, you should get a message from the browser asking "Do you want to close all tabs?" Since you DO have multiple tab pages open, the browser gives you this prompt.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ESC</strong> to get out of this dialog box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Currently, when you press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> in Chrome and multiple tabs are opened, the browser closes without displaying a prompt and all pages will be closed.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> a couple of times to make sure you are on the Jim's Cafe page.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>CTRL+F4</strong> to close just that page. Focus returns to the Navigating Web page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is still possible to have multiple instances of each web browser running and each instance can have multiple tabs. If you have two or more different browser sessions running you can press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to move from one session to another. For example, many of the sample pages for Surf's Up run in separate windows, not as tabbed pages.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-quick-key-manager-1">Navigation Quick Key Manager</h2>
<p>Navigation Quick Key manager is used to view, edit, or delete Navigation Quick Key assignments. To open Navigation Quick Key manager do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+J</strong> to switch to the JAWS window.</li>
<li>From within the JAWS window press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu.</li>
<li>Press <strong>N</strong> to open the Navigation Quick Key manager submenu. Focus moves to the first item of three, HTML/PDF.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the other two items. You find one for Microsoft Word and one for Microsoft Outlook.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can also find Navigation Quick Key Manager in the list of JAWS managers by pressing <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="aria-and-regions">ARIA and Regions</h2>
<p>ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) regions can be used to add additional navigation structure to web pages. Web page authors can add regions to web pages to make it easier to find the main parts of a page. For example, you might find a main region which is where the main content of a page begins. You may also find banner, navigation, and search regions on some web pages. When a web page loads, JAWS announces if there are regions on the page. Use the keystroke <strong>R</strong> to move forward from one region to another. Press <strong>SHIFT+R</strong> to move backward from one region to another. You may also use the keystroke <strong>INSERT+CTRL+R</strong> to open a JAWS list of regions for a web page.</p>
<p>The Surf's Up home page has three regions. There is a "main" region which begins near the top of the page. The main region is typically where the primary content of most web pages begins, and should be after, or below, the links that one typically finds near the top of the page for navigation to other parts of the web site. The Surf's Up home page and the remaining pages of Surf's Up also have a "content information" region. The content information region on most web sites, including Surf's Up, is typically the footer of the page and may contain more links and copyright information. We've kept the footer of Surf's Up pretty clean and empty of extra content for now. Finally, on the home page of Surf's Up only, there is a "navigation" region that contains links for just that, navigating to different parts of the Surf's Up web site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the current page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>R</strong> to move to the different regions on the page. Regions are not visible on the screen, but they are used to make it easy to get from one part of the page to another. The main region is where the main text for the page begins. Regions designate the different broad categories on the page, such as the search region, the banner region, and more.</li>
<li>Try pressing <strong>INSERT+CTRL+R</strong> to open a JAWS list of regions.</li>
<li>Use the Surf's Up link at the top of any of the secondary pages of Surf's Up to move back to the Surf's Up home page and try these keystrokes there as well.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the main region in the list. JAWS moves focus directly to that part of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many web sites have a graphic company logo, which is also a link, at the top of their web pages to make it easier for you to get back to their home page. Surf's Up mimics this behavior so you can practice using it as well. At the top of every page in Surf's Up besides the home page is a graphic link that simply reads, "Surf's Up." It is a small thumbnail image of a shark's fin which is also a link to the Surf's Up home page.</p>

<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="temporary-versus-permanent-changes">Temporary Versus Permanent Changes</h1>
<p>With JAWS you have the flexibility to make changes quickly that are temporary, or you can make changes that stay in effect permanently. Throughout the exercises in <em>Surf's Up - Surfing the Internet with JAWS</em> you will encounter some of these differences, which are described below.</p>
<h2 id="jaws-quick-settings">JAWS Quick Settings</h2>
<p>Use the Quick Settings dialog box to make changes very quickly without having to go into various other dialog boxes to do so. There are three different types of changes that can be made in the Quick Settings dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporary changes that revert back to normal settings as soon as focus switches to another program window.</li>
<li>Temporary changes that revert back to normal settings when JAWS is closed and restarted.</li>
<li>Permanent changes that stay in effect until you change them again at some other time. (This is the default setting.)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box, the items at the top of this list are specific to the program that has focus when the keystroke is pressed. So pressing <strong>INSERT+V</strong> while in Chrome shows options specific to reading web pages, whereas the items near the bottom of the list are more generic. This is very handy for making quick changes for testing or reading purposes.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Quick Settings are used to make changes that are application-specific. If you wish to make global changes to all programs, use Settings Center.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="documentation-for-the-jaws-quick-settings-dialog-box">Documentation for the JAWS Quick Settings Dialog Box</h3>
<p>The JAWS Quick Settings dialog box has a tree view of different options that can be changed, depending on the program being used. There is also a read-only documentation area within the dialog box that describes what each option does. To move to and read the documentation for any given item, select the item and press the <strong>TAB</strong> key to move to the read-only edit area and use normal reading commands to read the text describing what that option does.</p>
<h3 id="persistency-in-jaws-quick-settings">Persistency in JAWS Quick Settings</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of examples showing how having different persistency levels might benefit you:</p>
<ul>
<li>A friend is using your computer for a few minutes and her preferences are different than yours. She uses a different verbosity level and typing echo. You can set it so that JAWS is changed for her only as long as that session is open and running. When she hands you back your computer, just shut down and restart JAWS and your settings are back to normal.</li>
<li>You are downloading a large file and you want the progress bar announcements to be silent. Normally progress bar announcements are spoken. In this example you could set the persistence level so that the progress bar is only silent while focus remains in that window. As soon as you switch to a different window or program, progress bar announcements return to normal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The persistency level cannot be set for individual document settings. Document settings will always be written to disk.</p>
<p>By default, every change you make in Quick Settings gets saved to disk. This means that the changes you make will still be set the next time you quit and restart JAWS. It also means that the changes you make will still be set the next time you shut down and restart your computer. But what if you want the changes to be temporary and not permanent?</p>
<p>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> in Chrome to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the search edit box.</p>
<p>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the tree view. The first thing you notice is a node for Virtual Cursor options.</p>
<p>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to explore the items beneath this node.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>APPLICATION Key</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong> to open a context menu for any of these items. You should find the following choices in the context menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restore setting when JAWS exits</li>
<li>Restore setting when focus changes</li>
<li>Save the setting (checked). This is the default for all items.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a graphic icon out to the left of each item in the tree view showing an image representing save to disk. If you change to one of the other settings, the icon changes accordingly to a different icon. This option in Quick Settings gives you the ability to make temporary changes if you wish to. Personally, the author believes it is best for most JAWS users to leave everything set to the default, which is save to disk. Let's take a look at one more item.</p>
<p>If you closed Quick Settings, reopen it from Chrome with <strong>INSERT+V</strong>.</p>
<p>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the node for Virtual Cursor options. What if there were many different items beneath this node that had been changed? Perhaps some were set to restore settings when JAWS exits, some were set to restore settings when focus changes, and some were set to save all settings. Wouldn't it be easier to change them all at once instead of having to change them each individually?</p>
<p>While focus is on a node of the tree you can press the <strong>APPLICATION Key</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong> to open a context menu that controls the settings of every item within that node. Try it and you should find the following items in the context menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restore all settings for this node when JAWS exits</li>
<li>Restore all settings for this node when focus changes</li>
<li>Save all settings for this node</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this gives you as a JAWS user a lot of flexibility and control over how JAWS saves different settings. For most people the default setting, save to disk, is probably the best choice.</p>
<h2 id="settings-center-in-jaws">Settings Center in JAWS</h2>
<p>The <strong>JAWS Settings Center</strong> allows you to make permanent changes to the way JAWS behaves on the Web, or in other programs. Settings Center provides a consistent interface and central access point for JAWS features and settings.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong> in Chrome, the JAWS List of Managers appears.</li>
<li>Press <strong>S</strong> until you find Settings Center, then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it. Focus is in the search edit box. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the tree view. The tree view is where the major categories for changing settings are grouped. Press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move up and down the tree view. Press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open a closed group, and press <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong> to close an open group. You may also use first letter navigation to move to items in the tree view as long as they are not hidden inside of one of the closed groups.</li>
<li>Do not make any changes at this time. Just explore the dialog box. Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> and notice that one of the groups says "Web / HTML / PDFs" closed.</li>
<li>Press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open this group. Notice that there are several items within this group. You can explore them if you want by pressing <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>. Also notice that many of these items are closed, meaning there are more options within each of them.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> on most items in the tree will toggle through the available choices for that item. Do not change anything at this time. At the end of this exercise we will choose the Cancel button just to make sure.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong>. Focus moves to a read only text area. This is where the help topic for the item you just moved from in the tree is found. Use standard reading commands such as <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to read all of the text or <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to read the text by lines.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> again. If you made any changes before moving here, focus moves to an Apply button. If focus moves to the Apply button do NOT activate it at this time. Instead, go ahead and press <strong>TAB</strong> once more to move to the OK button. Do NOT activate the OK button at this time either.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> once more and focus moves to the Cancel button. You will activate this in a few minutes, but first continue to explore the dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> again. Focus moves to the Application combo box. Notice that since you were on a Web page when you opened Settings Center, the application highlighted in the combo box is Chrome. Settings Center always shows the name of the program you were in when it opens. For example, if you had been in Notepad when Settings Center opened, this combo box would say Notepad. That is because this gives you the ability to make changes that only affect the one program you were in when you started Settings Center. Sometimes you want to make changes to all programs, however.</li>
<li>Press <strong>HOME</strong> to move to the top of the list of items in the combo box. Notice that it says Default (All Applications). You don't have to move to the combo box to choose Default, however. If you want to switch to the Default settings just press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong> when Settings Center opens.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> again. Focus moves to the search edit box for Settings Center. The keystroke to jump here quickly is <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. This is a great tool to help you find settings quickly and easily in JAWS. Typing a search word or phrase in the edit box reduces the number of items that appear in the tree view list. Other exercises coming later in Surf's Up will give you opportunities to experiment more with this and other features of JAWS Settings Center. The search edit box is where the focus appears whenever you start Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> once more and focus returns to the tree view.</li>
<li>One more part of Settings Center is the configuration display pane. As you move through the tree view, a sighted user can simultaneously track cursor movement using the configuration display pane. Press <strong>F6</strong> to switch between the tree view and this pane. This is necessary when typing in an edit or edit spin box. Press <strong>F6</strong> again to return to the tree view.</li>
<li>For now, go ahead and press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Cancel button, and then activate it by pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Settings Center closes and any changes you might have made are not saved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can press <strong>INSERT+F1</strong> on an option in any JAWS dialog box to find out more information about that option.</p>
<h2 id="last-changed-settings">Last Changed Settings</h2>
<p>In both Settings Center and the Quick Settings dialog boxes there is an item at the bottom of the tree view called "Last Changed Settings." This group contains the last 25 options that were recently changed for an application or document. Note that once this group has 25 items, the last setting in the list is deleted when another item is added. To remove an item from the list, select it, press <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong>, and then select <strong>Remove</strong>. To remove all items from the list, select the Last Changed Settings group in the tree view, press <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong>, and then select <strong>Remove All</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="location-of-jaws-settings-files">Location of JAWS Settings Files</h2>
<p>JAWS stores settings files in your user files location for the version of Windows® you are using. Settings files are stored in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\version\settings\enu. The file extension used is JCF, which stands for JAWS Configuration File.</p>
<p>The word <em>username</em> in the path above represents your user login name for your computer. The word <em>version</em> in the path above represents the version of JAWS you are using.</p>
<p>To quickly find your user settings files, open the Utilities menu from the JAWS window, select the Explore Utilities Folder option, and then choose Explore My Settings.</p>
<p>Other ways to make permanent changes for JAWS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose an item (including Settings Center) from one of the menus in the JAWS user interface.</li>
<li>Choose another JAWS manager from the list of JAWS managers (<strong>INSERT+F2</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personalized-web-page-settings-with-jaws">Personalized Web Page Settings with JAWS</h2>
<p>If you want to make changes that are permanent, but only for a specific Web site, you can use the JAWS list of Personalized Settings for Web Pages. This is discussed in more detail later in Surf's up-Surfing the Internet with JAWS.</p>

<p><a href="_Surfs_Up_Start_Here.htm"><img src="images/Shark_Fin_50x50_New%20009.jpg" alt="Surf&#39;s Up" /></a></p>
<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="jaws-web-verbosity">JAWS Web Verbosity</h1>
<p>When reading content using the Virtual Cursor, JAWS alerts you to the beginning and end of various elements such as lists, tables, and regions. With JAWS support for ARIA continuing to improve and web developers becoming more aware of accessible design, the amount of extra information provided by the Virtual Cursor can become overwhelming when you just want to focus on the page content. To make it easier to determine what is spoken, JAWS now offers three levels of verbosity for the Virtual Cursor, giving you control over how much detail you want to hear when reading various web content. The three levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High</strong> - JAWS speaks the most information about elements on the page or inside a document. Everything except the start and end of application and document regions is announced at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> - This level is configured to provide the best user experience on most pages and documents and is the default verbosity level. By default, JAWS will not indicate the start and end for flash objects or frames, and only the start and end of navigation and main regions is announced. Note that the name and type for all regions is still announced when using the <strong>R</strong> and <strong>SHIFT+R</strong> Navigation Quick Keys to move by region or the <strong>O</strong> and <strong>SHIFT+O</strong> Navigation Quick Keys to move by article.</li>
<li><strong>Low</strong> - JAWS speaks as little structural information as possible about the elements on a page or inside a document. By default, only the start and end of tables and grids is announced at this level.</li>
</ul>
<p>To choose a verbosity level, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, and select Settings Center. Note that since you started Settings Center while Google Chrome web browser had focus, the title bar of Settings Center reads, "JAWS Settings Center - Chrome." This means this setting will only apply when using Chrome. Should you wish to apply this setting to all web browsers, one would first press the keystroke <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong> to change to the default settings before continuing the exercise.</li>
<li>In the Search edit box, type "web verbosity" without the quotes.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to "Web Verbosity Level" in the filtered search results in the tree view.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose the level you want.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to save your change and close Settings Center.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also choose a Virtual Cursor verbosity level to be active for a specific website. From the website where you want to use a different verbosity level, press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open Quick Settings, navigate to the Personalized Web Settings group, and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> on Virtual Cursor Verbosity Level to choose the verbosity level you want for the current site.</p>
<p>Each verbosity level is preset to provide the most optimal experience. However, just like with speech verbosity, each level can be further customized to give only the information you want to hear. For example, you may want to continue using the default Medium verbosity level, but you may want JAWS to announce a few more elements that are not spoken by default at this level.</p>
<h2 id="change-web-verbosity-to-look-for-more-at-medium-verbosity-level---practice">Change Web Verbosity to Look for More at Medium Verbosity Level - Practice</h2>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Configure JAWS to announce the Content Information region at the bottom of each Surf's Up page as you navigate with the arrow keys. Content Information regions are not indicated by default at the Medium verbosity level.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, and select Settings Center.</li>
<li>In the Search edit box, type "web verbosity" without the quotes.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to "Configure Web Verbosity Levels" in the filtered search results in the tree view and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to expand the "Configure Web Verbosity Levels" group.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Medium and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. A dialog box opens containing a tree view listing the structural elements that can be announced by the Virtual Cursor.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Pressing <strong>TAB</strong> one time moves you to a read-only text area containing a description of the currently selected element in the tree view.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>You can use the arrow keys to explore all of the items in this tree view or press <strong>R</strong> to jump directly to the Regions node.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you reach Content Information and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to check this region type.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the OK button. Focus returns to Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+A</strong> to activate the Apply button in Settings Center. Activating the Apply button allows you to make instant changes to settings without having to close the Settings Center dialog box. That way we can change the setting back in just a minute without having to re-open Settings Center.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to return to the JAWS Web Verbosity page. Settings Center is still running in the background and is still open. Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you hear JAWS say "Main Region End." Continue pressing <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> and you should hear JAWS say "Content Information," followed by the Back and Next links, and finally "Content Information End."</p>
<p>Repeat this exercise if you want to try selecting or clearing other elements that you may or may not want to have announced as you navigate pages.</p>
<h2 id="change-web-verbosity-back-to-default-setting">Change Web Verbosity Back to Default Setting</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to switch back to Settings Center.</li>
<li>This time, let's use the Last Changed Settings item in Settings Center to revert the change. Press <strong>END</strong> to move to the bottom of the tree view in Settings Center. JAWS should announce it as "Last Changed Settings, closed."</li>
<li>Press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open the tree node, and then press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to "Medium... (Web / HTML / PDFs ,Reading,Configure Web Verbosity Levels)."</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to reopen the dialog box containing a tree view listing the structural elements that can be announced by the Virtual Cursor.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you reach Content Information and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to uncheck this region type.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the OK button. Focus returns to Settings Center.</li>
<li>Finally, press <strong>ENTER</strong> once more to close Settings Center.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="html-tables-with-jaws">HTML Tables with JAWS</h1>
<p>A Web page author can use tables in two primary ways on the Internet. One is for the layout of structure on a Web page to place items where the author wants them to be in relation to other items on the page. These are called layout tables. The other type of table is called a data table. Data tables are the most common type of table.</p>
<p>JAWS announces when you enter and leave a table. A well-designed HTML table has a few different features. One of these is a caption, which is visible to a sighted user and is also read by JAWS. The caption is usually like a title, and generally appears above the table. Another design feature is the table summary. The table summary is not visible on the screen to sighted users. Web page designers can add summaries to the HTML code specifically for screen reader users. A good table summary provides a meaningful overview of the table, giving you some idea of what the table contains before you get there. Pay particular attention to the table summaries as you read through this page.</p>
<h2 id="reading-tables">Reading Tables</h2>
<p>You can use the JAWS navigation quick key <strong>T</strong> to move quickly between tables. On this page, each table also has a caption that is a level two heading. You can also move among the headings by pressing the JAWS navigation quick key <strong>H</strong> for headings. If you want to list all tables on the page, press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+T</strong>. You can then select a table and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to it.</p>
<p>Once you enter a table, you can use table reading commands to move through and read the information.</p>
<h3 id="table-layer-keystrokes">Table Layer Keystrokes</h3>
<p>Table layer keystrokes offer a fast and convenient way to navigate tables. The table layer eliminates the need to have to hold down several keys at once to perform a table navigation command.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the layered keystrokes for table navigation. Press and release <strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR</strong>, followed by <strong>T</strong> to get to the table layer. Then press any of the following keystrokes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>H</strong> or <strong>QUESTION MARK</strong> (<strong>?</strong>), list the keystrokes you can use in this layer</li>
<li><strong>ARROW Keys</strong>, move to cell above, below, left, or right</li>
<li><strong>NUM PAD 5</strong>, say current cell</li>
<li><strong>HOME</strong>, move to the beginning of the current row</li>
<li><strong>END</strong>, move to the end of the current row</li>
<li><strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>, move to the first cell in a table</li>
<li><strong>CTRL+END</strong>, move to the last cell in a table</li>
<li><strong>CONTROL+UP ARROW</strong>, move to the top of the current column</li>
<li><strong>CONTROL+DOWN ARROW</strong>, move to the bottom of the current column</li>
<li><strong>CONTROL+LEFT ARROW</strong>, move to the beginning of the current row</li>
<li><strong>CONTROL+RIGHT ARROW</strong>, move to the end of the current row</li>
<li><strong>CONTROL+ENTER</strong>, move to next table</li>
<li><strong>CONTROL+SHIFT+ENTER</strong>, move to prior table</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+UP ARROW</strong>, read the current row</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+PAGE UP</strong>, read from the current cell to the end of the row</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+HOME</strong>, read from beginning of the row to the current cell</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+NUM PAD 5</strong>, read the current column</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+PAGE DOWN</strong>, read from the current cell to the bottom of the column</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+END</strong>, read from the top of the column to the current cell</li>
</ul>
<p>The Table Layer remains active until you press a key that does not perform a table command, such as <strong>ESC</strong>, <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>, <strong>TAB</strong>, or <strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
<p>The default behavior for JAWS is to read only headers that have been properly marked as headers by the author of a table.</p>
<p>In many tables, the first row, going from left to right, contains headers for the information in the columns below it. Also, many times the first column, going up and down, contains headers for the information in the rows to the right. If a table is not properly coded, JAWS can be changed to treat the information in the first row and the first column as headers. The settings for JAWS are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only Marked Headers (default)</li>
<li>Off</li>
<li>Row</li>
<li>Column</li>
<li>Both Row and Column</li>
</ul>
<p>If a table has been properly marked up with column and row headers, when moving left and right in a table, you would hear the item in each column at the top of the column and then the contents of the current cell. When moving up and down in a table, you hear the item at the beginning of each row and then the contents of the current cell.</p>
<p>JAWS looks at the HTML code to see if the author of an HTML table has coded the table cell with a &lt;TH&gt; element, or table header. In addition, JAWS looks for the scope attribute, which can also be used by document authors to provide header information in tables. If a table is not specifically coded with proper column and row headers, JAWS can be changed to treat the table as if it did.</p>
<p>In the first two tables below you find examples of column and row headers that are marked up as headers. The first table has properly coded &lt;TH&gt; table header tags for both the first row and the first column. However, the second table only has properly coded &lt;TH&gt; table header tags for the first row. There are no row headers in the second table example. However, because these first two tables are marked up properly, JAWS reads the header information just fine.</p>
<p>In this first table the author used table headers for both the first row and the first column of the table, so when you use JAWS reading commands to read the current cell, you hear the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Column and row position in the table</li>
<li>Column header (time)</li>
<li>Row header (network)</li>
<li>TV show listing from the cell where the cursor currently is located</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are not in table layer mode, press and release <strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR</strong>, and then press <strong>T</strong>. Then press <strong>NUM PAD 5</strong> to read the current cell.</p>

<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to tell JAWS to read both column and row headers for the table above that does not have proper markup:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box while the Tables page is still in the foreground. The Quick Settings dialog box opens with focus in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>table titles</strong> in the edit box. The tree view below filters out all items not related to table titles.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the item Table Titles in the tree view. You should hear JAWS announce "Only Marked Headers."</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to change this to <strong>Table Titles - Both Row and Column</strong></li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The Quick Settings dialog box closes.</li>
<li>Navigate to the table above and try reading it again. You can press <strong>SHIFT+T</strong> to move to the prior table. Does it make more sense this time?</li>
<li>Set the Quick Settings back to <strong>Table Titles Announce - Only Marked Headers</strong> again when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fourth table has only the times listed across the top. The network names that were in the first column have been removed. Again, the author did <strong>NOT</strong> use table headers to mark up the HTML. When you read the current cell you hear only the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Column and row position in the table</li>
<li>TV show listing from the current cell</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the table is not marked up properly, JAWS does not read the column headers.</p>

<p>When you encounter this type of table you can change how JAWS reads column and row headers. In this case, you know that the information in row one, at the top of each column, is header information, even though it is not properly marked up. You also know that you do <strong>NOT</strong> want to have the first column treated as row headers.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to tell JAWS to read only column headers for the table above that does not have proper markup:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box while the Tables page is still in the foreground. The Quick Settings dialog box opens with focus in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>table titles</strong> in the edit box. The tree view below filters out all items not related to table titles.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the item Table Titles in the tree view. You should hear JAWS announce "Only Marked Headers."</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to change this to <strong>Table Titles - Columns</strong></li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The Quick Settings dialog box closes.</li>
<li>Navigate to the table above and try reading it again. You can press <strong>SHIFT+T</strong> to move to the prior table. Does it make more sense this time?</li>
<li>Set the JAWS Quick Settings Option back to <strong>Table Titles Announce - Only Marked Headers</strong> again when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="document-presentation-mode">Document Presentation Mode</h2>
<p>There are two different document presentation modes that you can use when reading tables with JAWS: Simple Layout and Screen Layout. With Simple Layout, each cell of the table is displayed on a separate line in the virtual buffer. Screen Layout mode allows you to read tables by row, just as they are presented on the screen. With Screen Layout each row of the table is displayed on a separate line and each cell is separated by a vertical bar. This lets you get a much better idea about how the table is structured and how different cells in a row relate to each other.</p>
<p>Screen Layout mode is also helpful when you want to copy an entire table row and paste it into another document as a single line. The default document presentation mode for JAWS is Simple Layout.</p>
<h3 id="to-enable-screen-layout-mode-for-the-current-web-browser-do-the-following">To enable Screen Layout mode for the current web browser, do the following:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>In your browser, press <strong>INSERT+V</strong>. The Quick Settings dialog box opens with focus in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>document presentation</strong> in the search edit box. The tree view below filters out everything that does not relate to document presentation.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until focus moves to Document Presentation Mode.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose Screen Layout.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> By default, the quick settings for JAWS are saved to your computer hard disk, and remain set this way until you change them back or to a different setting.</p>
<p>When you practice reading tables with JAWS in the following section, experiment with Screen Layout mode and Simple Layout mode to see which you like best.</p>
<h3 id="permanently-enable-screen-layout-mode-for-all-html-and-pdf-tables">Permanently Enable Screen Layout Mode for all HTML and PDF Tables</h3>
<p>If you determine that Screen Layout mode is better suited to your needs, you can do the following to permanently enable this feature in HTML and PDF tables.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In your browser, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>.</li>
<li>Select Settings Center and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong> to switch to the Default, all files, setting. You can read the title bar of Settings Center to verify this by pressing <strong>INSERT+T</strong>.</li>
<li>Focus is in the Search edit box. Type in "select layout" without the quotes.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Select Layout in the filtered results of the tree view in Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to toggle from Simple Layout to Screen Layout.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved. Settings Center closes.</li>

<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Try re-reading the previous table using Screen Layout mode instead of Simple Layout mode. If you need a reminder about how to switch document presentation modes, see the <a href="Screen_Layout.htm">steps for switching to Screen Layout mode</a>. When you are finished, change JAWS back to Simple Layout mode.</p>
<p>Surf's Up also makes use of cascading style sheets (CSS) for formatting purposes. Using CSS is a best practice technique for Web designers and is the best way to accomplish formatting. One of the formatting techniques used in Surf's Up is to have cells that are classified as table header elements colored with a lemon yellow background, which is darker than the ivory background of the other table cells.</p>
<p>The table below is an example of a table that uses the ID, AXIS, and HEADERS attributes to make JAWS speak different information when navigating different areas of the table. For example, when moving up and down the Employee Name column, you hear the division name as the row header. However, when moving up and down the Phone Extension column, you hear the employee name as the row header. The employee name is actually in column two, but the HTML code is telling JAWS to treat it as the row header in this case, rather than the text in column one. In this case, JAWS reads properly without you having to change any settings for JAWS, since the author of the table took the time to use good practices for coding the HTML of the table. Any given cell can reference any other cell (or cells) anywhere in the table as a header using this technique.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Sharon Jones</p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>This next table is much more complex, but notice how JAWS reads it. When moving up and down column two, where the company name is, the row header information is gathered from column one, the region. When moving up or down any column from three to eight, the row header information is gathered from column two, the company name. You also hear the axis attribute spoken with the words "Region" and "Where."</p>

<h1 id="using-forms-with-jaws">Using Forms with JAWS</h1>
<p>HTML forms allow you to access shopping carts, search engines, web-based email, online forums, and more. Forms include controls such as edit boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, and other controls similar to those used in dialog boxes.</p>
<p>JAWS takes advantage of the features of HTML used to create forms and allows you to access all kinds of form controls.</p>
<h2 id="moving-through-forms">Moving Through Forms</h2>
<p>The following is a list of JAWS navigation quick key commands that allow you to move quickly from one control to another. You can use the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key in combination with many of the keystrokes to move to the previous unit or element.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These commands do not work in forms mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also display lists of specific types of form controls. To do this, hold down <strong>INSERT+CTRL</strong> and press one of the navigation quick keys for moving through forms. For example, to view a list of all edit boxes on the page, press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+E</strong>.</p>
<p>To quickly locate a specific form control press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong>. This command lists all form controls and their contents on the current page. Move through the list and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to the selected control. Forms mode is automatically enabled so you are ready to make changes to the control. And if you have already entered information in a long form, use the Forms List to quickly review the information.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Forms mode is automatically turned off when you activate a button that submits a form.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong> to list all the form controls, and experience how easy it is to review the information. Try pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> from the list of form controls to go into forms mode and edit the form. Press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong>, or click outside the form fields if you are using a mouse, to get out of forms mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h2 id="auto-forms-mode-and-form-controls">Auto Forms Mode and Form Controls</h2>
<p>When you use the <strong>ARROW keys</strong> or press <strong>TAB</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> on a web page and land in an edit field or combo box, forms mode is automatically on. JAWS also plays a sound to confirm that you are in Forms Mode. This is known as Auto Forms Mode and is useful because you never have to remember to manually turn on Forms Mode using the <strong>ENTER</strong> key when you move to a form control such as an edit field. Additionally, if someone clicks into an edit box with a <strong>MOUSE Click</strong>, forms mode comes on automatically.</p>
<h3 id="sounds-indicating-forms-mode-on-or-off">Sounds Indicating Forms Mode On or Off</h3>
<p>You hear one sound when JAWS enters forms mode and a slightly different sound when JAWS exits forms mode. These sounds can be changed to different sounds if you prefer. Here's how:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In Chrome, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>.</li>
<li>Select Settings Center and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Focus is in the Search edit box. Type in "<strong>select sound for</strong>" without the quotes. JAWS filters out all results that do not match the search in the tree view below.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Select Sound for Entering Forms Mode in the filtered results of the tree view in Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. A dialog box of sound choices opens.</li>
<li>Press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the list of sounds. JAWS has over 180 sounds included that you can choose from. You can also use first letter navigation.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> or <strong>ALT+P</strong> to hear a sample of the sound.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button when you find a sound you want to use, and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate it. Focus returns to the Settings Center tree view.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Select Sound for Leaving Forms Mode in the filtered results of the tree view in Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. A dialog box of sound choices opens.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> or <strong>ALT+P</strong> to hear a sample of the sound.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved. Settings Center closes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, you can turn the sounds that indicate forms mode on or off by using the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box. Don't follow these instructions at the moment, since we'll be using the sounds for the exercises that follow. However, here is how to change it later if you need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type in <strong>"use sound"</strong> without the quotes. JAWS filters out all results that do not match the search in the tree view below.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the item in the tree view "Use Sound - checked" in the Virtual Cursor Options.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to uncheck the check box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Quick Settings closes and the changes are saved.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you exit the form control, either using the arrow keys, the tab key, or by clicking somewhere else outside of the form controls with a mouse, forms mode is turned off and you hear the sound indicating this. Forms mode is also automatically turned off when the form is submitted or the page refreshes. Alternatively, press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> at any time to get out of forms mode.</p>
<p>When you use JAWS on the Internet, JAWS uses the virtual cursor, an invisible reading cursor, as the default cursor for reading information. As you navigate, there is a visible reading highlight that surrounds the word or line where you are reading, which makes it easier to tell where the virtual cursor is. To complete a form on a web page, you need to use the PC cursor, which is a visible blinking cursor.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When using JAWS navigation quick keys, the default setting is for forms mode <strong>not</strong> to come on automatically. This can be changed in the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box accessed by pressing <strong>INSERT+V</strong> or in the JAWS Settings Center discussed earlier. Using navigation quick keys in forms is discussed in more detail later in this lesson.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-navigation-within-forms">Keyboard Navigation within Forms</h2>
<p>Keyboard navigation within forms can be done in many different ways. Most people will use one or a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARROW</strong> keys</li>
<li><strong>TAB</strong> key</li>
<li><strong>Navigation Quick Keys</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-the-arrow-keys-to-explore-a-form">Using the Arrow Keys to Explore a Form</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below and use just the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> to explore the form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</li>
<li>Let's explore how using the arrow keys works when a form control is encountered. Begin pressing <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> one line at a time. Stop when you reach the first field label, First *. Just after the label for First * is an edit box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> one time and listen. Did you hear JAWS announce "edit" and play a sound? The sound indicates that forms mode has come on automatically. JAWS announced that the cursor is now in the edit box. You could begin typing now and put your name here, but for now do not do that.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> again. Did you hear a different sound? Forms mode is now off again since the virtual cursor moved out of the edit box and back into the main part of the web page.</li>
<li>Continue to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the fields for Middle and Last edit boxes. Notice that as you move into an edit box with an arrow key, forms mode comes on automatically and you hear the sound indicating this has happened. Also, as you move out of an edit field with an arrow key, forms mode goes off automatically, and again you hear the sound indicating this has happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that as you use the arrow keys with JAWS, forms mode only comes on when you are in an edit box. Whenever an edit area is detected, JAWS allows you to begin typing immediately. Yet, at the same time, if focus is not in an edit area, reading mode stays on. This gives you the ability to quickly type information into edit boxes, and still gives you plenty of flexibility to move around the form.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Why is forms mode not turned on when buttons, check boxes, or other controls are encountered? The reason is because these controls can generally be activated without going into forms mode. For example, the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> toggles the check mark on or off for check boxes. Pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> also moves the selection of a radio button from one choice to another, and activates buttons such as the OK, Cancel, or Submit button. You don't have to switch to forms mode to do this.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-tab-key-to-explore-a-form">Using the TAB Key to Explore a Form</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below and use only the <strong>TAB</strong> key to move through the form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</li>
<li>Press the navigation quick key <strong>F</strong> to move to the first field on the page, the First * edit box.</li>
<li>Remember, forms mode does NOT come on automatically when using navigation quick keys. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into forms mode.</li>
<li>Go ahead and type your first name here if you have not already done so. Did you hear JAWS announce that this is a required field? Often, web page developers use the asterisk, *, to indicate required fields. The asterisk can be seen by sighted individuals and you can hear it with JAWS when reading through the form with the arrow keys. The text that JAWS spoke, First Name, this is a required field, is delivered by an ARIA attribute called aria-label. In this case the aria-label gives information that is not visible on the screen such as the word, "Name" and the phrase, "This is a required field." ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, and is a technical specification for increasing the accessibility of web pages.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next edit field, Middle. Did you hear JAWS announce, "Middle initial?" In this case the web page author used a different HTML attribute, the title attribute, to give you the extra information. The word "initial" is not visible on the screen. It is, however, shown as a visible tool tip to people who hover a mouse over the field.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> again to move to the Last * field. Again, you should hear JAWS announce, "Last name. This is a required field," as a result of the aria-label attribute.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you continue to press <strong>TAB</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> notice that as long as you are in an edit box, forms mode is turned on automatically. When the cursor moves out of an edit box, forms mode goes off automatically, and you hear the sound indicating this has happened.</p>
<h3 id="forms-that-automatically-advance-to-the-next-field">Forms that Automatically Advance to the Next Field</h3>
<p>Web page authors may sometimes create form fields that move the PC cursor to the next form field automatically. This can make a long day of filling out forms a lot easier! These types of form controls that automatically move the cursor to the next field are typically seen in fields that have a fixed number of characters, such as phone number fields and social security number fields. As soon as the final character is input, the form moves the cursor immediately to the next field or control.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow along and experience how some form fields can advance the cursor to the next field automatically when the first field is complete:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME.</strong></li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> several times to move to the Area Code edit box. This is the first of three telephone number edit boxes.</li>
<li>In this first one, type in three numbers. The focus automatically moves to the next field.</li>
<li>In the second phone number field, the Exchange edit box, type in another three numbers. The focus automatically moves to the next field, the four digit phone number edit box.</li>
<li>In the Number edit box, type in four numbers. Notice that the focus automatically moves to the next field, the email address field.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Web Track sample form used in Surf's Up does not collect or send any data. It is just a practice page.</p>
<p>You will occasionally come across similar types of auto-advance edit fields as you interact with forms on the web.</p>
<h3 id="autocomplete-settings-in-internet-explorer">AutoComplete Settings in Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>Most web browsers offer an AutoComplete feature to help you remember things you type. This can happen when typing in edit boxes for web page addresses, search inquiries, and more. For instance, this option is enabled by default in Chrome. If you are in an edit field where you have typed some information previously, as you type, a list forms near the edit field containing a match of any words beginning with the letters you type. You can then choose a word or phrase from the list and press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next form control without having to retype the whole word or phrase.</p>
<p>If you choose to keep the AutoComplete Settings on, if you press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> you may find that the focus goes into a list of items that you have typed at some point in the past. This is designed to make it easier for you when filling out forms. It keeps you from having to retype a lot of information. To get out of such an edit box list of choices, perform the following two steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the list.</li>
<li>Then press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> to turn forms mode off again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can continue to use the arrow keys to explore and read through the form.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Use the search edit box on the Freedom Scientific web site.</p>
<p>Go to the Freedom Scientific web site, <a href="https://www.FreedomScientific.com" class="uri">https://www.FreedomScientific.com</a>.</p>
<p>Start from the top of the page by pressing <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</p>
<p>Press <strong>TAB</strong> until you find the Search edit box. You should hear a sound indicating that forms mode is on. If not, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into forms mode.</p>
<p>Begin typing some text, perhaps the word <strong>JAWS</strong>. Now, press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to see if you find a list of items containing the word JAWS. On my computer I find the following, because I have done searches of our web site before:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAWS</li>
<li>JAWS keystrokes</li>
<li>JAWS screen reader</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Next, choose one of the items in the list. Just press <strong>TAB</strong> once you find it in the list. The list closes and the search edit box is populated with that item. Focus moves to the Go button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to move back to the search edit box to verify that the item you chose in the list is there now.</li>
<li>Let's delete this item from the list. When you pressed <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to move back to the search edit box, the word or phrase that was there becomes highlighted, or selected. Just press the <strong>DEL</strong> key. The word or phrase is now gone.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> again to begin moving through the AutoComplete list.</li>
<li>Now, let us say that you do not want to populate the search edit box and wish to leave it empty. Press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the list.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> to get out of forms mode.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>. Focus should move to the Go button. Now you can continue reading the page with the arrow keys.</li>
<li>When you are finished practicing with the Freedom Scientific web page, press <strong>CTRL+F4</strong> to close it.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="navigation-quick-keys-in-forms-with-auto-forms-mode-off-default-setting">Navigation Quick Keys in Forms with Auto Forms Mode off (Default Setting)</h3>
<p>When using navigation quick keys in forms, forms mode does not turn on automatically. This is great because it gives you the ability to move quickly from one part of a form to another without having to worry about forms mode coming on.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have an email program which is web-based. Often there will be a check box in front of each new item in the Inbox. You can quickly move to a check box by pressing the letter <strong>X</strong> and then read the subject line of that message. However, you may not want to go into forms mode because you want to move to a Reply button. If forms mode came on when you moved to the check box you would have to turn off forms mode before you could use the navigation quick key <strong>B</strong> to move to the Reply button.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below to experiment with navigation quick keys:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</li>
<li>Press the navigation quick key <strong>B</strong> several times to explore what buttons are available in this form. You should find a total of five different buttons. This is a nice way to find out if there is a Submit button or a Send button, for example.</li>
<li>Press the navigation quick key <strong>A</strong> to explore the radio buttons in the form.</li>
<li>Next, press the navigation quick key <strong>X</strong> to explore the check boxes in the form. The check boxes are located in two different areas on this form.</li>
<li>Let's say you have explored the form and now want to move back to the edit box for the first name, which is located near the top of the form. Just press the navigation quick key <strong>E</strong> and focus wraps back to the top of the page where the first name edit box is located.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can tell from this example how nice it is to be able to use navigation quick keys to explore a form without having forms mode come on. It is also great to be able to move directly and efficiently to certain controls within a form.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The default setting for JAWS is to NOT go into forms mode when using navigation quick keys. However, this can be changed. Read the next section to find out how.</p>
<h3 id="navigation-quick-keys-in-forms-with-auto-forms-mode-on">Navigation Quick Keys in Forms with Auto Forms Mode On</h3>
<p>If you use forms a lot, you may want to have forms mode come on when using navigation quick keys. You can change JAWS to have forms mode come on if you are using navigation quick keys, and pause for a given number of seconds on a control.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below to experiment with navigation quick keys set to turn on forms mode after pausing for several seconds on a control:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</li>
<li>Open the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box by pressing <strong>INSERT+V</strong>. Focus is in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type in <strong>"delay"</strong> without the quotes. JAWS filters out all results that do not match the search in the tree view below.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the item "Navigation Quick Key Delay - Never" in the Virtual Cursor Options.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to change this to three seconds.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. JAWS Quick Settings closes and the changes are saved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when using auto forms mode, and navigating with navigation quick keys, JAWS will toggle Forms Mode on after three seconds if you remain on that control. This only happens when the control is an edit box, list, or a combo box. Do you remember why forms mode does not come on for check boxes or buttons? It is because their state can be changed or activated by using the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Now, press the navigation quick key <strong>E</strong> to move through the edit boxes of the form. Make sure to press it within less than three seconds to confirm that you can still navigate without going into forms mode. If you need to change the delay to a little longer, you can adjust the time in the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box up to a maximum of five seconds.</li>
<li>Next, press the navigation quick key <strong>E</strong> again until you find the first name edit box. This time, wait for three seconds. Did you hear the sound indicating that forms mode is now on after the delay?</li>
<li>Press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> to get out of forms mode for now. You hear the sound indicating that forms mode is now off.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see how this could be handy for people who fill out forms a lot! For now, go ahead and change the settings back to Navigation Quick Key Delay - Never using the instructions given in steps one through six above.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you go to a particular domain, such as an Intranet or a group of web pages such as Microsoft.com or FreedomScientific.com where you want this to happen all the time you can use Personalized Settings for JAWS to turn forms mode on when using navigation quick keys every time you visit that site. Personalized Settings can be found in the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box below the section for Virtual Cursor Options.</p>
<h3 id="check-boxes-and-radio-buttons">Check Boxes and Radio Buttons</h3>
<p>To quickly select a check box or radio button on a form, press <strong>NUM PAD SLASH</strong> when the virtual cursor is on the item. If the selected control is a check box, the state of the check box is toggled. If the control is a radio button that is not selected, this command selects the radio button. JAWS does not switch to forms mode, so you can easily continue reading the page. You can also use <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to toggle the state of a check box or select a radio button without going into forms mode.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below to experiment with check boxes and radio buttons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME.</strong></li>
<li>Press the navigation quick key <strong>A</strong> to move to the first group of radio buttons. You hear, "Product(s) in Warranty, Yes radio button checked, one of two."</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You may not hear the label spoken properly in Chrome at the present time. Whenever you hear something that is not expected, don't hesitate to try the same page in a different browser, such as Firefox. In Firefox the label is currently spoken properly.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the second radio button. You hear, "radio button not checked."</li>
<li>Press either the keyboard command for the left mouse button, <strong>NUM PAD SLASH</strong>, or the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to move the check mark from the first radio button to the second one. If you are using a mouse, just click the second radio button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> to move back to the first radio button and verify it is not checked.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move back to the second radio button and verify it is checked.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that throughout the above process, forms mode was never turned on. You used the navigation quick key <strong>A</strong> for radio buttons to move the virtual cursor to a radio button, and changed the check mark without getting into forms mode.</p>
<h3 id="combo-boxes">Combo Boxes</h3>
<p>When reading with the arrow keys, if the virtual cursor moves to a combo box forms mode is not automatically turned on. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> Forms mode may come on even when navigating with the virtual cursor if AutoComplete settings are used in that control.) To change the selection, press <strong>ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to open the list of choices. Forms mode comes on. Then, use the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> to select an item. Press <strong>ALT+UP ARROW</strong> to close the list of choices. The item is now selected in the combo box and forms mode goes off again. Then press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next control. (Or use the <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> to continue reading.)</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below to experiment with combo boxes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME.</strong></li>
<li>Press <strong>C</strong> to move to the combo box for Action Taken.</li>
<li>Press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> to move to the form label, which is to the left of the combo box visually, but on the line above the combo box in the virtual world. You should hear JAWS say "action taken."</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move back to the combo box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> again to move below the combo box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that all this time, forms mode has not come on. You are still reading with the virtual cursor.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> to move back up to the combo box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into forms mode. Did you hear the sound indicating that JAWS is now in forms mode? At this point press the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> and explore the choices available in the list of items within the combo box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Going into a combo box using this method causes only the selected item in the list to be visible within the combo box. Visually, the rest of the list of choices cannot be seen.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> to get out of forms mode.</li>
<li>Now, try doing it a different way. Still with the virtual cursor on the combo box, press <strong>ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong>. Did you hear forms mode come on again? Now the list of items in the combo box has been opened so that all items are shown visually. Use the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> again to move up and down the list to select a choice.</li>
<li>When you have made a selection you want to keep, press <strong>ALT+UP ARROW</strong>. This action does two things. First, it closes the list with the item you had chosen in the list now visible as the selected choice in the combo box. It also turns forms mode off. Again, you hear the sound indicating that forms mode is off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spend a few minutes on this combo box practicing the two methods discussed to get into and out of forms mode, and make a selection from the list of available items. When you are finished, make sure that forms mode is off by pressing <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="semi-auto-forms-mode">Semi-Auto Forms Mode</h2>
<p>Some options for forms mode can be changed. For example, you might prefer to use the classic forms mode (forms mode off) instead of auto forms mode. Or you may want to use Semi-Auto forms mode. Let us take a look at the Semi-Auto forms mode using JAWS Quick Settings.</p>
<p>You can make some adjustments to forms mode by using the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box. JAWS automatically saves the changes you make until you change them again.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the <a href="WebTrack.htm">Web Track Sample Form</a> and follow along with the instructions below and explore some of the items you can change in the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, make sure the cursor is at the top of the page. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type in <strong>"auto"</strong> without the quotes. JAWS filters out all results that do not match the search in the tree view below.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the choice that reads "Auto Forms Mode - Auto" in the Virtual Cursor Options. There are three options here, Auto, Semi-auto, and Manual.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to change this to Semi-auto.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate it. Quick Settings closes and the changes are saved. Focus returns to the Web Track sample page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the controls on the page. The virtual cursor finds the label, First *.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the edit box. Notice that forms mode has not come on automatically.</li>
<li>Continue to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the controls on the page. The virtual cursor reads the label first and then the edit box second for each control. Notice that you do not hear the different sounds indicating forms mode is on, then off, and then on again constantly as you arrow through the form. This is great for people who have to use forms all day long and who have been listening to the different sounds as JAWS goes into and out of forms mode. Much less of a distraction!</li>
<li>Now, press <strong>TAB</strong> and <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to navigate through the controls on this page. Notice that when you encounter edit fields or combo boxes, Forms Mode automatically turns on and off.</li>
<li>When you do come across an edit box using the <strong>ARROW keys</strong> that you need to enter text in, just press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into forms mode.</li>
<li>Press <strong>NUM PAD PLUS</strong> to get out of forms mode when you are finished or press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next form control.</li>
</ol>
<p>We think once you get accustomed to using semi-auto forms mode you will like it very much. Go ahead and follow the instructions above if you wish to switch auto forms mode back on again. When you find the selection that says "Auto Forms Mode - Semi-Auto" just press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to change it back to "Auto" again. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="form-control-prompts">Form Control Prompts</h2>
<p>HTML allows the author of a web page to specifically associate text prompts (or labels) with form controls. JAWS recognizes when a prompt is specifically associated with a control, and speaks the correct prompt when you move to that control. If no prompt is specifically associated with a control, JAWS attempts to identify text positioned near the control as the prompt. This is most accurate when the text is directly to the left or above the form control.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-form">PDF Form</h2>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the attached <a href="ProductInformationRequest.zip">PDF sample form</a> and try it using the techniques you have learned. JAWS handles PDF forms the same way as HTML forms.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-virtual-html-features">List of Virtual HTML Features</h2>
<p>Take a minute to look at and use the JAWS List of Virtual HTML Features, <strong>INSERT+F3</strong>. This is a handy way to generate lists of many items found in the virtual environment.</p>

<p><a href="_Surfs_Up_Start_Here.htm"><img src="images/Shark_Fin_50x50_New%20009.jpg" alt="Surf&#39;s Up" /></a></p>
<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="reading-pages-with-frames">Reading Pages with Frames</h1>
<p>Some web pages use frames to display content. A frame is an area of the page that browsers treats like a separate window. Each frame is capable of displaying an independent Web page. The <a href="Frame-Example.htm">Freedom Scientific Company Info</a> page is a sample web page that uses frames to display different types of information. One frame contains addresses for Freedom Scientific locations, another contains a brief history of the company, and the last frame contains some general information about Freedom Scientific.</p>
<p>In the following exercises, you will use a sample web page to learn how to navigate frames:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <a href="Frame-Example.htm">Freedom Scientific Company Info</a> sample Web page. Notice that JAWS says there are three frames.</li>
<li>When you first open the sample Web page, you are in the Company Locations frame. Press <strong>INSERT+F9</strong> to display a list of all the frames on this page.</li>
<li>Select "Corporate History" and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. JAWS moves you to the Corporate History frame.</li>
<li>Use the JAWS reading commands to read all the text in this frame. Notice that as you navigate, JAWS does not indicate when you leave the current frame and move into the next frame. This is the default behavior and is explained below.</li>
<li>Press <strong>M</strong> to move to the next frame on the page. Notice that JAWS reads the first line of text in the frame which in this case is a level 1 heading.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+M</strong> to move back to the previous frame.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, JAWS does not announce when you enter or leave a fframe. This is because many frames on websites are not labeled properly and most of the time, a frame's title does not accurately reflect its content. One example is a Google Maps frame that is used on some websites to show the location of the particular company. Many times, the lable for these frames is just a series of letters and numbers, which provides no useful information when announced by JAWS.</p>
<p>If you would like JAWS to indicate when you enter or leave a frame, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, and select Settings Center.</li>
<li>In the Search edit box, type "web verbosity" without the quotes.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to "Configure Web Verbosity Levels" in the filtered search results in the tree view and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to expand the "Configure Web Verbosity Levels" group.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Medium and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. A dialog box opens containing a tree view listing the structural elements that can be announced by the Virtual Cursor.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F</strong> until you reach Frames and press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to toggle the announcement of this element.</li>
<li>Select OK to exit this dialog box and select OK once more to close Settings Center.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, to see how this works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <a href="Frame-Example.htm">Freedom Scientific Company Info</a> sample Web page. JAWS now says "Contact Information Frame" which is the first frame on the page.</li>
<li>Begin using the arrow keys to read the text. As you move through the page, JAWS announces the name of the previous frame and says, "Frame end." JAWS then announces the name of the next frame.</li>
<li>Press <strong>M</strong> and <strong>SHIFT+M</strong> to move between frames. JAWS now speaks the actual name of the frame instead of reading the heading as it did in the previous exercise when frame announcement was disabled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="inline-frames">Inline Frames</h2>
<p>Inline Frames are embedded directly within a Web page and display the contents of another page. Visually, these types of frames usually look like images or banners. Inline frames are often used by Websites to display advertisements. To ignore inline frames use Quick Settings as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong>. Quick Settings opens with focus in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type in <strong>inline</strong>. The tree view below the edit box changes to filter out results that do not match.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the item Inline Frames Show. The default is On.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to toggle this setting to Off.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Quick settings closes and the changes are saved.</li>
</ol>

<p>﻿— Author: ‘Freedom Scientific Training Department, a Vispero Brand’ description: This web site demonstrates the use of JAWS and Fusion on the Internet. keywords: ‘navigating web pages, JAWS, language detection, automatic language switching’ lang: en title: Languages with JAWS on the Internet —</p>
<p><a href="_Surfs_Up_Start_Here.htm"><img src="images/Shark_Fin_50x50_New%20009.jpg" alt="Surf&#39;s Up" /></a></p>
<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="languages-with-jaws-on-the-internet">Languages with JAWS on the Internet</h1>
<p>JAWS provides language switching with any supported speech synthesizer. When a Web page author indicates the language of an entire page, or just part of a page, if the synthesizer in use supports that language, JAWS uses the language specific version of the synthesizer to speak the text. The synthesizer must support the language of the information.</p>
<p>If the synthesizer does not support the language specified for a page or part of a page, JAWS still indicates the language of the information.</p>
<p>To demonstrate automatic language detection, we start in English and write:<br />
"My computer speaks English."</p>
<p>Then we write the same sentence in French,<br />
<span lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ordinateur parle français</span><br />
and then in Spanish,<br />
<span lang="es" lang="es">mi computadora habla español</span><br />
and in Portuguese,<br />
<span lang="pt" lang="pt">meu computador fala o português</span><br />
and the same in German,<br />
<span lang="de" lang="de">mein computer spricht deutsch</span><br />
and in Russian,<br />
<span lang="ru" lang="ru">Мой компьютер говорит по-русски</span><br />
and in Finnish,<br />
<span lang="fi" lang="fi">Tietokoneeni puhuu suomea</span><br />
and in Italian,<br />
<span lang="it" lang="it">il mio computer parla italiano</span><br />
and in Greek,<br />
<span lang="el" lang="el">Ο υπολογιστής μου μηλάει ελληνικά,</span><br />
and in Polish,<br />
<span lang="pl" lang="pl">Mój komputer mówi po polsku</span><br />
and in Chinese,<br />
<span lang="zh-cn" lang="zh-cn">我的電腦說中文</span><br />
</p>
<p>JAWS switches between the languages very smoothly, when it can. If JAWS only said, "Russian," "Greek," or "Polish," instead of reading the text in those languages, this indicates that your speech synthesizer (Eloquence, for example) does not support those languages. If you are using Vocalizer Expressive, it indicates that you do not have those particular voices installed.</p>
<p>JAWS includes a utility that makes it easy to seamlessly sample and install or remove Vocalizer Expressive 2 premium voices. To install Vocalizer Expressive voices, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+J</strong> to open the JAWS application window.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+O</strong> to open the Options menu, expand the Voices submenu, and then select Add/Remove Voices to open the Add/Remove Vocalizer Expressive Voices utility.</li>
<li>In the Select a Language combo box, select the language that you want to download voices for.</li>
<li>In the Premium Voices list box, press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> on the voices you want to install. You can select as many voices as you like. To hear a sample of the current voice before deciding if you want to select it, press <strong>ALT+P</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the Install Selected Voices button to begin the installation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/Synthesizers">Synthesizers download page</a> to locate more free voices and languages for your use.</p>

<p>JAWS makes reading and using the Internet easy and fun. However, Web page authors must follow certain guidelines to make their pages accessible to JAWS and other screen reading software. JAWS reads most pages well, even if they are not designed with accessibility in mind. Occasionally, you may come across a page that is poorly designed or difficult to use with JAWS. In this section, you will learn some tricks for dealing with these difficult Web pages.</p>

<p>Some Web pages automatically refresh - or reload - after a certain period of time. Usually this is done to update information on the page in a timely fashion. When a page refreshes, JAWS moves you back to the beginning of the page. This can interrupt what you are doing. To see an example of a page like this, go to the <a href="e-stocks-refresh.htm">refreshing version of the E-Stocks sample page</a> and try to read through it. This version of the E-Stocks sample page is designed to refresh every twenty seconds so you can practice this lesson.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> Notice that JAWS informs you how often this page reloads. You must be using Beginner verbosity to hear this message.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow along with the steps below to make pages that automatically refresh easier to work with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <a href="e-stocks-refresh.htm">refreshing version of the E-Stocks sample page</a>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong>. Quick Settings opens with focus in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>page refresh</strong> in the search edit box. The tree view below the search edit box filters out all items that do not match the search phrase.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Page Refresh for the virtual cursor options.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose "Off."</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Quick Settings closes and the changes are saved.</li>
<li>Try reading through the refreshing version of the E-Stocks sample page again. The page still refreshes every 20 seconds, but you can read the text without being interrupted or returning to the top of the page.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="working-with-improperly-tagged-images">Working with Improperly Tagged Images</h2>
<p>Sometimes a Web page author does not assign alternate text, a title, or a long description to images on the page. JAWS ignores images like these because the program cannot provide you with any useful information. However, if the image is also a link, then JAWS announces the location (or file path) of the image. You can also view the destination URL of the image link.</p>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> You can also have JAWS announce images on the page with no descriptive text that aren't links. Alternatively, you can tell JAWS to ignore all images on the page. To do this, press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open Quick Settings. Look for "Graphics Show - Tagged" and choose "All" to hear all images on the page, or choose "None" if you don't want JAWS to announce any images.</p>
<p>The image below this paragraph is the Freedom Scientific corporate logo. It is also a link to the Freedom Scientific Web site. This image does not have any descriptive text. When you move to the image, JAWS reads the name of the file. Unfortunately, in this case the file name is also not descriptive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.FreedomScientific.com"><img src="./images/asdkflruTYI173x53lpoiMMnzser33B.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to obtain some more information about this image:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong>. The Quick Settings dialog box appears. Focus is in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type in <strong>untagged</strong>. Quick Settings filters out everything else that does not match the search term.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to "Untagged Graphical Links Show - Image Source" in the virtual cursor options.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose "Untagged Graphical Links Show - URL."</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Quick Settings closes and the changes are saved.</li>
<li>Press <strong>G</strong> to make sure focus is back on the Freedom Scientific logo image link. Notice that JAWS now reads the destination of this graphic link, which is <a href="http://www.FreedomScientific.com">www.FreedomScientific.com</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Be sure to follow the steps above and change this setting back to "Untagged Graphical Links Show - Image Source" when you are finished testing this.</p>
<h2 id="getting-more-information-about-links">Getting More Information about Links</h2>
<p>Sometimes the text of a link will not be very descriptive. For example, a Web page may have a link called "Click here." To change how JAWS reads links on a Web page, do the following:</p>
<p>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong>. Quick Settings opens with focus in the search edit box.</p>
<p>Type <strong>text links</strong> in the search edit box. Quick Settings filters out everything in the tree view below the search edit box except for items that match the search phrase.</p>
<p>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to find "Text Links Show Using - Screen Text" in the virtual cursor options.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to cycle through the available options. You find the following choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alt Attribute</strong> - JAWS looks for and reads information provided by the Alt attribute if assigned.</li>
<li><strong>Longest</strong> - JAWS speaks the longest string of information for each link.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Search</strong> - JAWS searches for information in the order specified in the "order list" in Settings Center and reads the first information found.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong> - JAWS first looks for and reads information provided by the &lt;title&gt; attribute. If no title text is found, JAWS reads the on screen text.</li>
<li><strong>Screen Text</strong> - JAWS reads the on screen text. This is the default setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, press <strong>ESC</strong> to get out of the Quick Settings dialog box.</p>
<p>The following is an example of a link with both screen text and a title attribute:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.freedomscientific.com/Services/TrainingAndCertification" title="The Training and Certification Web page is the starting point of training for JAWS, ZoomText, Fusion, and more.">Training and Certification</a></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the instructions below to switch between the screen text and the title and notice how JAWS reads each:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the Quick Settings dialog box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>text links</strong> in the search edit box. Quick Settings filters out everything in the tree view below the search edit box except for items that match the search phrase.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to find "Text Links Show Using - Screen Text" in the virtual cursor options.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to cycle through the available options until you find <strong>Text Links Show Using - Title</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Quick Settings closes and the changes are saved.</li>
<li>Now re-read the link.</li>
<li>Open the JAWS list of links with <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> and notice the title now appears there as well.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ESC</strong> to get out of the list of links when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Be sure to follow the steps above when you are finished and change JAWS back to <strong>Text Links Show Using - Screen Text</strong> in the virtual cursor options again.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> The next two links both have the same screen text, but contain a different title. Which of the two links pertains to learning more about Fusion? Follow the instructions above to change JAWS from Text Links Show Using - Screen Text in the virtual cursor options to Text Links Show Using - Title. Open the JAWS list of links now using <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> and find these two links. How do the links read in the list of links? When you are finished be sure to change JAWS back to the default setting, Text Links Show Using - Screen Text. Look again at the links with the JAWS list of links.</p>

<h2 id="skipping-past-site-navigation">Skipping Past Site Navigation</h2>
<p>Many sites have site navigation elements, such as navigation bars or a long series of links, at the top of each page. These links are a useful way to help visitors get around the site. However, designs like this can make it difficult for users of screen readers to get to the content of each page on the site, since you have to read through all the links first.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Some sites may provide a link at the top of each page called "Skip to Main Content," "Skip Navigation," or something similar. You can use these links to move past the site navigation and get to the page content.</p>
<p>To skip past site navigation links, buttons, and other elements, use the navigation quick key <strong>N</strong>. Pressing <strong>N</strong> moves you to the next block of text that is not a link. Usually, pressing <strong>N</strong> a few times will take you right to the main content of the page.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-browser-notifications">Accessing Browser Notifications</h2>
<p>From time to time, your browser may display a notification or alert depending on what you are doing. These alerts may include but are not limited to blocked popup windows, running active content, saving website logon information, or downloading files.</p>
<p>JAWS will announce when a notification appears followd by the text of the alert. If focus does not automatically move to it and remains on the web page, press <strong>F6</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+F6</strong> to move to the notification. There will most likely be one or more buttons that you can move to by pressing <strong>TAB</strong> or <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong>. The notification closes once you choose one of the available buttons to perform an action.</p>

<h1 id="using-the-jaws-find-command">Using the JAWS Find Command</h1>
<p>You can use the JAWS Find command to find specific words or phrases on a Web page. This works on long Web pages even if that information is not currently in view on the screen. The Find command searches from the location of the cursor to the bottom of the document by default, so it is best to start at the top of the page by pressing <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>.</p>
<p>Open the sample page <a href="Jims_Cafe.htm">Jim's Cafe at Innisport</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to go to the top of the page.</p>
<p>Press <strong>CTRL+F</strong> to open the <strong>JAWS Find</strong> dialog box. Focus is in an edit box where you can type a search keyword or phrase. You can press the <strong>TAB</strong> key to move from one control to another within the dialog box. The different controls include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find what edit box. Press the <strong>DOWN</strong> or <strong>UP</strong> arrow keys to move to previously searched for items. You can also open a list of the items in the combo box by pressing <strong>ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong> and then use first letter navigation to move to an item more quickly. It contains a history of the last 20 entries searched for.</li>
<li>Context Specific History check box. This check box controls whether or not the Find history is context specific for the current site. The check box is selected by default.</li>
<li>Maintain history of recent finds. This check box controls whether or not the Find What combo box maintains a history of items searched for. The default is checked.</li>
<li>Direction radio buttons, the default is to search forward</li>
<li>Ignore case checkbox, the default is checked, and</li>
<li>Find, Delete, Clear Find History, and Cancel buttons. The default is the Find button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The JAWS find is the default find in Internet browsers where the virtual cursor is supported. If you want to use the application's native find dialog box, first press <strong>INSERT+3</strong> on the numbers row (JAWS pass through keystroke), followed by the keystroke <strong>CTRL+F</strong>.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Let's say you heard that Jim's Cafe offers a really great club sandwich. Do the following to search to see if that is listed on this page. Type the words "club sandwich" and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. If you started at the top of the page, the words "club sandwich" are not visible on the screen. They are further down on the page. JAWS moves to the phrase and reads the line where the search phrase is found.</li>
<li>Use the JAWS Say Word command (<strong>INSERT+NUMPAD 5</strong>). You should hear the word "club" spoken.</li>
<li>Use the JAWS Next Word command (<strong>INSERT+RIGHT ARROW</strong>). You should hear JAWS say, "sandwich." JAWS moved you to the phrase right at the beginning of the word "club."</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move back to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>JAWS Find</strong> dialog box again by pressing <strong>CTRL+F</strong> and search for the word "town." You hear that the words around the word you searched for are "sleepy town of Innisport."</li>
<li>Press the keystroke to repeat the Find command (<strong>F3</strong>). You hear that the words around your search word now are "in downtown Innisport." Notice that your search word is actually part of a larger word in this instance.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F3</strong> again and listen to the text you find.</li>
<li>Continue pressing <strong>F3</strong> until you get a message that says, "wrapping to top," which indicates JAWS reached the last instance of the word "town" on this particular Web page and continued the search back at the top of the page again. JAWS also wraps when searching backward from the top of the page using <strong>SHIFT+F3</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When searching for words or phrases with JAWS, the important keystrokes to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL+F</strong> to open the <strong>JAWS Find</strong> dialog box.</li>
<li><strong>F3</strong> to repeat the search in the forward direction.</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT+F3</strong> to repeat the search in the backward direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The JAWS find dialog box is different from the regular find dialog box in other programs. When you are in programs that have their own find dialog box you can still choose the JAWS find command as an alternative if you wish to. In those instances, use the JAWS keystroke <strong>INSERT+CTRL+F</strong>.</p>
<p>Continue to experiment with this handy feature of JAWS. You will find this a very useful way of searching Web pages for specific information.</p>

<h1 id="skim-reading">Skim Reading</h1>
<p>Skim reading is a powerful reading, searching, and navigation tool available in JAWS. This feature allows you to quickly review long documents by reading the first line or sentence of each paragraph. Alternatively, you can search for passages containing specific words or phrases. In this section, you will learn how to skim read a Web page with JAWS. You will also learn how to create text rules and use them to skim Web pages for specific information.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Before beginning the first exercise in this section, you should ensure that your skim reading preferences use the default settings. If you have previously changed these settings, press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> and verify that the <strong>Read First Line of Every Paragraph</strong> radio button is selected before continuing.</p>
<h2 id="skimming-a-document">Skimming a Document</h2>
<p>You can skim read a lengthy Web page to get an overview of the content and search for paragraphs or sections containing specific information.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow along with the instructions below to practice skim reading text on the Internet with JAWS.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="FS-Software.htm">Freedom Scientific Software Solutions</a>, and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to begin skim reading. JAWS reads the first line of each paragraph on the page.</li>
<li>You can change your skim reading preferences so that JAWS reads the first sentence of each paragraph instead of the first line. Before doing this, press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>To change your skim reading preferences, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Skim Reading Tool," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Alternatively, you can use the shortcut <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to display the <strong>Skim Reading</strong> dialog box.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>In the <strong>Use Rule Type</strong> area, use the arrow keys to select the <strong>Read First Sentence of Every Paragraph</strong> radio button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+S</strong> to activate the <strong>Start Skim Reading</strong> button to begin skim reading. Notice that JAWS now reads the first sentence of each paragraph.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="viewing-the-skim-reading-summary">Viewing the Skim Reading Summary</h2>
<p>JAWS can display a summary of the current page in the Results Viewer. This summary contains all the text you would hear if you began skim reading from your present location using your currently selected options. Each segment of text is a link. You can move to a segment and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to jump to its location within the document. Once you create a summary, it remains available until you generate another, even if you switch to a different document or program.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Practice creating and using a skim reading summary. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="FS-Software.htm">Freedom Scientific Software Solutions</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Skim Reading Tool," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Create Summary</strong> button is the default button when you are in the Skim Reading dialog box, so just press <strong>ENTER</strong> to create a summary.</li>
<li>JAWS displays a summary of the page in the Results Viewer. Use the arrow keys to explore the text in the Results Viewer. Notice that JAWS inserts a number before each sentence or line in the summary.</li>
<li>Move to line number five, which should read "Product: Fusion," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. JAWS moves you directly to that line on the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to move back to the Results Viewer summary again.</li>
<li>Move to line number seven, which should read "Product: ZoomText Screen Magnification," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. Again, JAWS moves you directly to that line on the page.</li>
<li>For now, press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to move back to the Results Viewer window, and then close it by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="creating-and-using-text-rules">Creating and Using Text Rules</h2>
<p>So far, you have used the skim reading feature to read the first line or sentence of each paragraph. However, you can create text rules to search for specific words or phrases on the page. JAWS then searches the document for any lines, sentences, or paragraphs (depending on your preferences) containing the text. Text rules are saved and can be reused in any document and in any application.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to create a text rule that you will use later to skim read the Freedom Scientific Software Solutions page.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="FS-Software.htm">Freedom Scientific Software Solutions</a>, and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Skim Reading Tool," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Use Rule Type</strong> area, use the arrow keys to select the <strong>Text Rules Apply for Reading</strong> radio button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next control. Focus lands in the Rules History combo box. If you have never created rules before, the only item here is the item &lt;New&gt;. If you had created rules previously, there would be more than one item in this combo box. For now, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next control.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Text Search Pattern</strong> edit box, enter the word you want to search for. Type <strong>"product"</strong> for this exercise.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the default button, the <strong>Create Summary</strong> button.</li>
<li>JAWS finds each line containing the term "product" and displays it in the Results Viewer. Notice how this allows you to find out quickly which products are listed on this page.</li>
<li>Use the arrow keys to move to line number one, which reads, "Product: JAWS for Windows," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. JAWS moves you to the beginning of the section of the page that discusses JAWS.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to move back to the Results Viewer, and then press <strong>ESC</strong> to close it for now.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="modifying-text-rules">Modifying Text Rules</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> In this exercise, you will create a second text rule.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Skim Reading Tool," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>If you are continuing from the previous exercise, focus lands in the <strong>Rules History</strong> combo box. Be sure that the text rule you created ("product") is selected in the <strong>Rules History</strong> combo box. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the <strong>Text Search Pattern</strong> edit box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Text Search Pattern</strong> edit box, type over the existing text and enter the word "JAWS" in its place.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Create Summary button. The Skim Reading Summary appears with lines of text that contain the word JAWS. You should find four matches.</li>
<li>When you finish exploring the Skim Read Summary, press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the results viewer.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="changing-the-speak-unit">Changing the Speak Unit</h3>
<p>In the previous exercises JAWS read each line containing the search term.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Change your skim reading preferences so that JAWS reads the first sentence or the entire paragraph instead.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the sample page <a href="FS-Software.htm">Freedom Scientific Software Solutions</a> and press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Skim Reading Tool," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Use Rule Type</strong> area, verify that the <strong>Text Rules Apply for Reading</strong> radio button is selected. Also, verify that the text rule you created ("JAWS") is selected in the <strong>Rules History</strong> combo box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the <strong>Speak Unit</strong> combo box, and select "Sentences containing text rule."</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to create a Skim Reading Summary. Notice that the Skim Reading Summary now contains full sentences containing the word "JAWS."</li>
<li>When you are finished reading the results, press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the Results Viewer.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="deleting-a-rule">Deleting a Rule</h3>
<p>Once you have finished using a rule, you can delete it.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to delete the practice rule you created.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Skim Reading Tool," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Rules History</strong> combo box, select the text rule that you created to search for the word JAWS.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the <strong>Delete Rule</strong> button, and press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.</li>
<li>Move to the <strong>Close</strong> button, and press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the Delete Rule button there is also a button to Delete All Rules.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-rules">Creating New Rules</h3>
<p>Rules you create are saved automatically by JAWS. The name of the rule is normally the same text you use in the search. When creating rules, make sure you investigate the following items, unless you plan to overwrite an existing rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any time you want to create a new rule, make sure you first select New in the Rules History combo box. Otherwise, you may edit an existing rule.</li>
<li>When creating a color rule, make sure that none of the attribute checkboxes were left checked from a previous rule.</li>
<li>Make sure you check the settings in the Speak Unit combo box for each rule to be certain the outcome is what you want. Press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to move there quickly to verify the settings.</li>
<li>When using a rule that does more than basic text searches, you may need to check the Use Regular Expression checkbox.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced-text-rules">Advanced Text Rules</h3>
<p>You can create more advanced text rules that utilize "and/or" conditions or other logical expressions. For example, if you only want to search for text units that contain two or more words, separate each word with ".*" (that is, a period followed by an asterisk with no spaces between the words or symbols). For example, you can use the following expression to search for text units containing both the words "JAWS" and "ZoomText:"</p>
<p><strong>JAWS.*ZoomText</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <strong>Use Regular Expression</strong> check box is normally left unchecked for simple text rules. A regular expression is a search string that uses special characters to help you define the search and match text patterns. To use more advanced searches you need to select this check box.</p>
<p>If you want to search for text units that contain any of several different words, separate each word with "|" (that is, a vertical bar with no spaces between the words or symbols). For example, you can use the following expression to search for text units containing either the words "JAWS" or "ZoomText:"</p>
<p><strong>JAWS|ZoomText</strong></p>
<p>Even more advanced expressions are possible as well. For example, you can use the following expression to search for text units containing any year starting with "19:"</p>
<p><strong>19\d{2}\s</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For more information on creating complex expressions like this, refer to the section <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az24scfc(vs.71).aspx">Regular Expression Language Elements</a> in the MSDN® Library.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-colors-and-attributes">Searching for Colors and Attributes</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Choose the Attributes and Color Rules Apply for Reading radio button in the Use Rule Type group to create rules that search for colors or attributes.</p>
<p>The sample document <a href="FS-Software.htm">Freedom Scientific Software Solutions</a> has some red text and some bold attributes in it for practice. Make sure you are at the top of the document first by pressing <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>. If you don't already have it open, please do so now.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the Skim Reading dialog box again if it is closed.</li>
<li>Move to the Use Rule Type radio buttons and make sure the fourth one, Attributes and Color Rules Apply for Reading, is selected by pressing <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to it.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Rules History combo box. It should say New. If not, press <strong>HOME</strong> to find it at the top of the list. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move through these new choices that have now become available.</li>
<li>You land in the Text Color combo box. The default should be star, or asterisk.</li>
<li>The next control is the Background Color combo box. Again, the default should be star, or asterisk. Press <strong>TAB</strong> again.</li>
<li>Now you begin working through a series of checkboxes, all of which are unchecked by default, for various attributes. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move through all of them. Keep in mind that when you start looking for attributes, the results are cumulative. In other words, when you check the bold and underlined checkboxes, only text that is BOTH bold and underline, simultaneously, is searched for.</li>
<li>Continue to press <strong>TAB</strong> until you reach the Text Color combo box again. In this combo box, press the letter <strong>R</strong> and you should land on red.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> again and you land in the combo box for Background Color. Unless you are looking for a specific background color, leave this on the star, for any background. So now, the search you're working on would find red text on any background.</li>
<li>You could continue to press <strong>TAB</strong> to move through the rest of the controls, but the only one you need for this exercise is the Speak Unit combo box. Go ahead and press the access key to jump there directly, <strong>ALT+U</strong>. Set it to sentences for this rule.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to begin the summary. Explore it when finished. Did you hear something like four matches found?</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are finished, press <strong>ESC</strong> to get out of the Skim Reading Summary. For more information on Skim Reading with JAWS be sure to read the DAISY book on Skim Reading. You can find it on the <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/training/training-downloads.asp">Training Downloads Web page</a>.</p>

<h1 id="using-placemarkers-and-the-custom-placemarker-page-summary">Using PlaceMarkers and the Custom PlaceMarker Page Summary</h1>
<h2 id="placemarkers">PlaceMarkers</h2>
<p>PlaceMarkers allow you to quickly and easily navigate to commonly used areas of your favorite Web pages or HTML documents when using JAWS. You can use PlaceMarkers to jump between certain areas of a page, mark important sections of an HTML document, or indicate key form elements. For example, you could use PlaceMarkers to move to required fields in a complicated form or specific paragraphs in a long HTML document. Press the navigation quick key <strong>K</strong> to move to the next PlaceMarker, or press <strong>SHIFT+K</strong> to move to the prior PlaceMarker.</p>
<p>A random selection of fictitious stock quotes for today are listed on the <a href="e-stocks.htm">E-Stocks sample page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Open the E-Stocks sample page, and follow along with the directions below to navigate to the table containing stock listings.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to go to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>T</strong> to move to the table which contains stock listings.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you hear JAWS say "Change," which is the third column. The first column has the stock symbol, and the second column has the stock price.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>CTRL+ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to move down to the second row and JAWS should say ATVI, which is the stock symbol in column one, followed by a number and a percentage. The number and the percentage are the amount of change for ATVI stock since the page was last updated.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="inserting-placemarkers">Inserting PlaceMarkers</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to put several PlaceMarkers in this table.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+K</strong> to display the PlaceMarker list.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to choose the <strong>Add</strong> button. An edit box appears with the number and the percentage taken from the Web page. This text is highlighted, so type over it and give this PlaceMarker the name of "ATVI."</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close the PlaceMarker dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong> two more times. You should hear JAWS identify that the focus is in the cell at the intersection of the row heading LEA and the column heading Change. You can press <strong>CTRL+ALT+NUM PAD 5</strong> to read the current cell coordinates, column headings, and cell contents. Focus should be in column three, row four. This is the percentage change for the stock symbol LEA in column one.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+K</strong> to display the PlaceMarker list.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to create a new PlaceMarker. The text for the current price change and percentage should appear in the edit box that displays. Again, JAWS has taken text from the position of the virtual cursor on the page. Type in the stock symbol "LEA."</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close this dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+ALT+DOWN ARROW</strong> two more times to move to the row containing the percentage change for the stock symbol NT in column one.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+K</strong> to display the PlaceMarker list.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to create a new PlaceMarker. Type "NT" to replace the suggested text taken from the Web page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close this dialog box.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="navigating-with-placemarkers">Navigating with PlaceMarkers</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Now, practice moving from one PlaceMarker to the next by pressing the navigation quick key <strong>K</strong> to move forward and <strong>SHIFT+K</strong> to move backwards.</p>
<p>Notice that you will hear JAWS announce "wrapping to top" or "wrapping to bottom," depending on the direction you are going when JAWS reaches either the bottom or the top of the page.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Next, take a few minutes to explore part of the PlaceMarker dialog box.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+K</strong> to display the PlaceMarker list.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+E</strong> to hear the default button in this dialog box. You should hear JAWS announce that the <strong>Add</strong> button is the default button.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select the first PlaceMarker in the list.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>INSERT+E</strong> to read the default button. Notice that the default button is now <strong>Move To</strong>. This is a smart dialog box. Initially, when you first enter it, JAWS assumes that you want to add a new PlaceMarker. However, after you select an existing PlaceMarker in the list, JAWS assumes that you want to move to one of them.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to select the third PlaceMarker, "NT."</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to this PlaceMarker. Notice that JAWS begins reading the text of the cell that the PlaceMarker is located in. JAWS remembers, down to the character, where you set your PlaceMarkers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sharing-placemarkers">Sharing PlaceMarkers</h3>
<p>PlaceMarkers remain in place even when you shut down JAWS and come back again. You can also share PlaceMarkers with other JAWS users. The PlaceMarkers are stored in the Settings\Enu\PlaceMarkers folder. The file name will be the URL of the Web page followed by the file extension PMI.</p>
<h3 id="other-placemarker-options">Other PlaceMarker Options</h3>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Take a look at some of the other parts of the PlaceMarker dialog box.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+K</strong> to display the PlaceMarker list.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select the first item in the list, which is the stock name ATVI in the second row.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>TAB</strong> key to move to the <strong>Add</strong> button.</li>
<li>Continue pressing the <strong>TAB</strong> key to explore the other buttons. You can change the name of a PlaceMarker, remove a PlaceMarker, or remove all PlaceMarkers.</li>
<li>For now, press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the PlaceMarker list.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="custom-placemarker-page-summary">Custom PlaceMarker Page Summary</h2>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Use the custom PlaceMarker page summary to automatically read the stocks you want to monitor whenever you visit this page.</p>
<p>To begin, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <a href="e-stocks.htm">E-Stocks sample page</a> and press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to display the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>"custom"</strong> without the quotes. The tree view below the search edit box changes to show settings containing the word custom.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Custom Page Summary in the General Options node of the tree view. By default, it shows Do Nothing.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to choose either <strong>Speak PlaceMarkers On Page Load</strong> or <strong>List PlaceMarkers in Results Viewer On Page Load</strong>. If you choose <strong>Speak PlaceMarkers On Page Load</strong>, JAWS reads the custom PlaceMarker page summary from the PlaceMarker locations with speech only. If you choose <strong>List PlaceMarkers in Results Viewer On Page Load</strong>, JAWS displays the PlaceMarker page summary in the Results Viewer.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F5</strong> to refresh the E-Stocks sample page. You can also use the access key <strong>ALT+Q</strong> to activate the Update Quotes button on the page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Firefox uses the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key in addition for access keys on Web pages. If you are using Firefox, press <strong>ALT+SHIFT+Q</strong> to activate the Update Quotes button.</p>
<p>When the page refreshes, JAWS gives you a summary of the PlaceMarkers on this page with speech or with the Results Viewer, depending on how you set it. You hear each stock that you marked, and the change in that stock's value. This is an example of how you can use the PlaceMarkers and the custom PlaceMarker page summary to track changes and updates to Web pages that you visit frequently.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To choose a custom PlaceMarker page summary that applies to all HTML pages for an entire domain, such as FreedomScientific.com or Google.com, use the Personalized Settings feature of JAWS. When you press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to start Quick Settings do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Type <strong>"custom"</strong> without the quotes. The tree view below the search edit box changes to show settings containing the word custom.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Custom Page Summary in the Personalized Web Settings node of the tree view. By default, it shows Do Nothing.</li>
<li>Try changing the settings as described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personalized settings remain in effect the next time you go to any page on that domain. Personalized settings are discussed in a later module.</p>
<p>To choose a custom PlaceMarker page summary setting that applies to <strong>all</strong> HTML pages, refer to <a href="example2.htm">Custom PlaceMarker Page Summary Step-by-Step Instructions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-placemarkers">Temporary PlaceMarkers</h3>
<p>You can create one temporary PlaceMarker per Web page by pressing <strong>CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K</strong> in the spot where you want to place it. The temporary PlaceMarker is also saved in the PMI file. You can only have one temporary PlaceMarker per page, but you can move it to a different location by pressing <strong>CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K</strong> again in a new spot on the page.</p>

<h1 id="personalized-web-page-settings">Personalized Web Page Settings</h1>
<p>You can configure many JAWS settings for specific Web sites. Personalized settings apply to all pages of a given domain, such as CNN dot com or Freedom Scientific dot com. Some examples where using personalized settings could be useful might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off heading announcement on Web sites that use headings to format information rather than structure it.</li>
<li>Turn off inline frames on sites that use them for advertising.</li>
<li>Turn off announcement of image map links on sites that do not provide alternate text for them, but do provide text links as well.</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the various JAWS settings work for you to enhance your experiences on the Internet.</p>
<p>JAWS includes many configurable settings to access information on Web pages as efficiently as possible, and JAWS uses default settings that provide the most information on the majority of Web sites. However, there are many Web sites that are not designed with accessibility in mind or do not use HTML correctly. When using JAWS default settings, some of these Web pages may not provide enough information, while others may provide too much.</p>
<h2 id="what-settings-can-be-personalized">What Settings can be Personalized?</h2>
<p>You can personalize many types of Web settings. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent Web sites from automatically refreshing, so the information does not reload and cause JAWS to read from the top of the page all over again.</li>
<li>Turn off graphic links on sites where alternate text is not provided or where the graphic links do not provide useful information.</li>
<li>Turn off heading announcement when headings are not used to structure information on a page.</li>
<li>Turn off navigation quick keys on pages that use certain types of access keys so the keys do not conflict.</li>
<li>Personalize Web settings for forms, frames, lists, and long quotations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personalizing-web-settings">Personalizing Web Settings</h2>
<p>Do the following to create or modify personalized settings for a Web page. Note that changes made are saved permanently to JSI files (for example, FreedomScientific.com.jsi) and do not apply to other Web pages. JSI files are stored in the PersonalizedSettings folder, which can be found by opening the Utilities menu from the JAWS window, selecting the Explore Utilities Folder option, and then choosing Explore My Settings.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the Quick Settings tree view.</li>
<li>Press <strong>P</strong> to move to the Personalize Web Settings group. If necessary, press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to expand the group.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the different options and groups within Personalize Web Settings, and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to make changes.</li>
<li>After making all necessary changes, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and then press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to save changes and exit Quick Settings.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sharing-personalized-settings">Sharing Personalized Settings</h2>
<p>JAWS stores personalized settings information in JSI files. To share your personalized settings with other JAWS users</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the JAWS application window, press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu and press <strong>X</strong> to activate the Explore Utilities Folder option.</li>
<li>Navigate to Explore My Settings and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. A folder opens that contains all of the files you have had JAWS modify or create for you.</li>
<li>Select the folder PersonalizedSettings and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it.</li>
<li>Locate the JSI file with the domain name of the page that uses the personalized settings you want to share. For example: "Google.com.jsi."</li>
<li>Copy this file and distribute it to others. Those you share your JSI file with need to copy the JSI file into their user folder on their computer following the steps above. They can now use that HTML page with your personalized settings.</li>

<p><a href="_Surfs_Up_Start_Here.htm"><img src="images/Shark_Fin_50x50_New%20009.jpg" alt="Surf&#39;s Up" /></a></p>
<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="speech-and-sounds-schemes">Speech and Sounds Schemes</h1>
<p>Have you ever wanted to hear things differently, perhaps to speed up your reading? Or perhaps you want to hear items you may be missing that you could read if only you knew they were there? If a button, check box, or other control within a Web page could be identified with a different voice, rather than using extra speech, it would mean you would have less to listen to.</p>
<p>Speech and sounds schemes let you use voices, spoken text, or sounds to identify various elements of Web pages, dialog boxes, and documents. For example, you could use different notes from a piano to indicate different heading levels. You can also assign speech or a sound to specific attributes such as HTML attributes or text attributes in a word processing document. Many Web page elements have both ALT and TITLE attributes. JAWS reads the ALT attribute by default and you may never know that a title is available. Perhaps the title would give you more information. Alternatively, you might want JAWS to identify bold text in a document by reading it in a deep voice. When you use speech and sounds schemes to alter the way JAWS reads information, you can store your associations as a scheme that you can apply at any time. You can also easily switch between schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To change the active scheme, press <strong>INSERT+ALT+S</strong>. Use the arrow keys to select a new scheme and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. This scheme remains the active scheme until you change it again.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Explore the Select a Scheme dialog box.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+ALT+S</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to explore the choices in the list.</li>
<li>Make sure that Classic is the one you have selected before you press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close the dialog box, and move on with the lesson.</li>
</ol>
<p>To open the Modify Schemes dialog box do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In Chrome, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>.</li>
<li>Select Settings Center and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong> to switch to the default file.</li>
<li>Focus is in the Search edit box. Type in "scheme" without the quotes.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to "Active Speech and Sounds Scheme" in the filtered results of the tree view in Settings Center. You can switch schemes here by pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The Settings Center has two sides. On the left is the tree view and on the right is the configuration display pane. As you move through the tree view, a sighted user can simultaneously track cursor movement using the configuration display pane.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F6</strong> to move from the tree view to the configuration display pane. This is necessary when typing in an edit or edit spin box. Focus should be on the Select Speech and Sounds Scheme combo box. Classic will be selected there unless you have changed schemes prior to now.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong>. Focus moves to the read only text area for Scheme Description.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> again. Focus moves to the Modify Schemes button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> once more and focus moves back to the Select Speech and Sounds Scheme combo box. Make sure that <strong>Classic</strong> is selected here before going any farther.</li>
<li>Now, press <strong>F6</strong> to go back to the tree view. Focus moves back to the Select Speech and Sounds Scheme node of the tree view. Don't press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> at the moment. Pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> here will cause items in the combo box to change.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Scheme Description. Do you notice how the tree view corresponds to the controls in the configuration display pane?</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> again to move to Modify Schemes in the tree view.</li>
<li>Now, press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> on this and the Modify Schemes dialog box opens.</li>
</ol>
<p>Move on now to the next section where you will create a new scheme.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-scheme">Creating a New Scheme</h2>
<p>A scheme is a collection of settings that you save as a single group. You can use schemes to quickly customize your JAWS speech and sound settings. You can switch between schemes quickly. Some examples might include schemes for the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proofreading word processing documents</li>
<li>Leisurely reading, without proofreading</li>
<li>Searching for text with certain attributes, such as bold, underline, or italics</li>
<li>Announcing more options on certain Web pages that may not be apparently available by just reading the text on the screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Use JAWS to create a new scheme by following the steps below. If you already have the Modify Schemes dialog box open, skip ahead to step eight below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In Chrome, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>.</li>
<li>Select Settings Center and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong> to switch to the default file.</li>
<li>Focus is in the Search edit box. Type in "scheme" without the quotes.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Modify Schemes in the tree view.</li>
<li>Now, press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> on this and the Modify Schemes dialog box opens.</li>
<li>In the Select Speech and Sounds Scheme combo box, make sure that Classic is selected before continuing with the exercise. If it is not, press the letter <strong>C</strong> several times to move through all of the items that start with that letter to find it.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move through the dialog box and choose the Create New Scheme button. An Untitled - Edit Scheme multi page dialog box opens with focus on the General tab page. The cursor is in the Scheme Description edit area. The text description from the classic scheme is highlighted there.</li>
<li>For now, type something like "My new scheme."</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it by pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The Save As dialog box appears.</li>
<li>Give the new scheme a name, such as "My Test Scheme," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. Focus returns to the Modify Scheme dialog box, with focus on the Create New Scheme button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+S</strong> to save the current scheme.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the <strong>OK</strong> button, and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate it. A message appears asking, "Do you want to make your practice scheme the active scheme for Default (All Applications)?" For now, choose the <strong>NO</strong> button. This closes the Modify Scheme dialog box, returning focus to the tree view of JAWS Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved. Settings Center closes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> The Modify Scheme dialog box is a multi-page dialog box composed of several different tab pages. In the next exercise you will take a look at the dialog box in more detail using the scheme you just created. You will use the Edit Scheme dialog box to assign speech or a sound to almost any element that JAWS recognizes.</p>
<p>Open the Modify Schemes dialog box again:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INSERT+F2</strong></li>
<li><strong>Settings Center</strong></li>
<li><strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong> to select the default file</li>
<li>In the Search edit box type in <strong>"scheme"</strong> without the quotes</li>
<li><strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Modify Schemes in the tree view</li>
<li><strong>SPACEBAR</strong> and the Modify Schemes dialog box opens</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are continuing this exercise immediately after the previous exercise, the active scheme in the list should be "Classic." Find your practice scheme in the list of available schemes before continuing.</p>
<p>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to and <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate the <strong>Edit Selected Scheme</strong> button. Focus is in the Scheme Description edit box of your new scheme, on the General tab page where you entered a description previously. You can modify this text any time by repeating these steps to get here.</p>
<p>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> to move to the <strong>Control Type</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to move through and explore the list of control types. Notice that all of the controls are set to speak the control type using the normal voice.</p>
<p>For the time being, continue to press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> and explore all of the tab pages in this dialog box. There are tab pages you can use to modify the way JAWS reads control states, attributes, font names, font sizes, colors, indentation, HTML attributes, and more. Eventually, focus cycles back to the <strong>General</strong> tab.</p>
<p>If you plan to continue with the next series of instructions, you can leave this dialog box open. If not, choose the <strong>Cancel</strong> button and focus returns to the JAWS Settings Center.</p>
<p>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to either the OK button to save changes or the Cancel button to discard any changes. Activate the button with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved, or not, depending on which button you choose. Settings Center closes.</p>
<h2 id="assigning-sounds-to-html-elements">Assigning Sounds to HTML Elements</h2>
<p>You may recall that previously in the Surf's Up lesson on Dealing with Difficult Pages, there was a link for the Training and Certification web page that had a link in the foreground and a title attribute in the background. If you did not know that the title attribute was there, you might never find and read the extra information the author of the page intended to provide.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> In this section, you will change your scheme so it associates a sound with an HTML element such as a title attribute. To begin, open the Modify Schemes dialog box, if necessary, and make sure you select the scheme you created. Then, choose the <strong>Edit Selected Scheme</strong> button and do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> until you move to the HTML tab page. There are already several different HTML elements that JAWS identifies listed here.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to explore the list. Did you notice that Title is not in the list? We'll add it.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Add button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Alternatively, you could also press the access key <strong>ALT+A</strong> to activate the Add button without having to move to it first.</li>
<li>Type the word <strong>title</strong> in the Add HTML Element Attribute edit field.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Next button. A Select Behavior dialog box appears asking if you want to speak the item or play a sound when a title attribute is encountered on a Web page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to select the Play Sound radio button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Next button. The Select Sound dialog box appears with a list of over one hundred sounds that are included with JAWS.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+P</strong> or <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to sample any sound in the list as you press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want to hear a sound while you are also listening to speech, like text on a Web page being read, the sound should be fairly crisp and loud enough to hear.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>For this exercise, press <strong>M</strong> until you select the MetalDing.wav sound. Press <strong>ALT+P</strong> to hear a preview of this sound. After you have previewed this sound, press <strong>ENTER</strong>. The Select Sound dialog box closes and focus returns to the Edit Scheme dialog box. Notice that now you have a rule defined for title that reads, "title, play sound, MetalDing.wav" in the list of attributes that JAWS will now look for. You can press <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> to re-read the item in the list.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Focus returns to the Edit Selected Scheme button in the Modify Scheme dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+S</strong> to activate the Save Selected Scheme button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. A message appears asking, "Do you want to make your practice scheme the active scheme for Default (All Applications)?" For now, choose the <strong>NO</strong> button. Focus returns to JAWS Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved. Settings Center closes.</li>
<li>Switch to your test scheme. Press <strong>INSERT+ALT+S</strong> and find it in the list. Once you find it in the list, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close the Select a Scheme dialog box.</li>
<li>The line below this has the same example of a link with both screen text and a title attribute that was on the page with the lesson on Dealing with Difficult Pages. Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the link. You should hear the text of the link spoken as well as the MetalDing.wav sound.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://support.freedomscientific.com/Services/TrainingAndCertification" title="The Training and Certification Web page is the starting point of training for JAWS, ZoomText, Fusion, and more.">Training and Certification</a></p>
<p>Now that you hear the MetalDing sound played, you know that in addition to the text of the link, which is visible on the screen, there is also a title attribute for this link. The title is not visible on the screen, but you know it is there. Do you remember how to switch JAWS so that it can read the title information instead of the screen text for this link?</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow the steps below to switch JAWS to read the title information.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+V</strong> to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the search edit box.</li>
<li>Type <strong>text links</strong> in the search edit box. Quick Settings filters out all results that do not match the search phrase.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you select "Text Links show Using - Screen Text."</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to toggle this until you hear "text Links show Using - Title."</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and then activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The Quick Settings dialog box closes.</li>
<li>Now re-read the link.</li>
<li>Open the JAWS list of links with <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> and notice the title now appears there as well.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ESC</strong> to get out of the list of links when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Remember to repeat the steps above and change JAWS back to <strong>Text Links Show Using - Screen Text</strong> when you are finished.</p>
<p>Experiment with the other HTML elements available in the Modify Scheme dialog box. You can assign sounds to headings, form controls, graphics, frames, image maps, tables, and more.</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-html-attributes">Ignoring HTML Attributes</h2>
<p>What if you don't want to hear some attributes that JAWS speaks on Web pages? For example, perhaps you don't want to hear JAWS say, "Clickable," when you encounter links or other content that includes OnClick attribute. JAWS also has the ability to ignore HTML attributes.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> To ignore an HTML attribute, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the Modify Scheme dialog box select the scheme you want to modify. Then activate the <strong>Edit Selected Scheme</strong> button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> to move to the <strong>HTML</strong> tab. This tab contains a list of HTML attributes that have already been defined. OnClick is one of these. For this exercise, press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you select "OnClick" in the list.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>TAB</strong> key one time to move to the Behavior group of radio buttons. Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to and select the <strong>Ignore</strong> radio button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Focus returns to the Edit Selected Scheme button in the Modify Scheme dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+S</strong> to activate the Save Current Scheme button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Focus returns to JAWS Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved. Settings Center closes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="create-a-scheme-to-speak-bold-text-using-the-bold-voice-alias">Create a Scheme to Speak Bold Text Using the Bold Voice Alias</h2>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> In this exercise you will create a scheme that looks for bold text and speaks it in a different voice.</p>
<p>You can use voice aliases to have JAWS announce certain items, attributes, or states in a different voice. In this section, you will assign a voice alias to bold text. To begin, open the Modify Scheme dialog box and then do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the Select Scheme combo box, select the scheme you created earlier, and then choose the <strong>Edit Selected Scheme</strong> button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> until you move to the Attributes tab. You are in a list of attributes. This list contains one definition for the Default setting, which is set to ignore attributes, and a few other definitions already created by Freedom Scientific.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+A</strong> to choose the Add button. An Add Attribute dialog box opens with a list of check boxes you can choose for different attributes such as bold, underline, italics, and more.</li>
<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select the <strong>Bold</strong> check box. Feel free to explore the other items you could check, but for this exercise, only check bold. When you are finished exploring, choose Next. The Select Behavior dialog box of radio buttons appears.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you check multiple items here <strong>ALL</strong> items must be present in the same text in order to match what you are looking for. In other words, if you select both bold and underline, the text must have both attributes present to match the rule. If you want to look for <strong>EITHER</strong> bold <strong>OR</strong> underline, you would create a separate rule for each.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to and select the <strong>Speak Item Text Using Voice</strong> radio button, and then choose <strong>Next</strong>. The Select Voice Alias dialog box appears with a list of over thirty different voice aliases that Freedom Scientific has already created.</li>
<li>Use the arrow keys to select the BoldVoice voice alias, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Finish button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Focus returns to the Edit Selected Scheme button in the Modify Scheme dialog box.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+S</strong> to activate the Save Current Scheme button.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button, and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Focus returns to JAWS Settings Center.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the OK button and activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. The changes are made and saved. Settings Center closes.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may need to switch to your new scheme to test your voice alias. Press <strong>INSERT+ALT+S</strong> to open the <strong>Select a Scheme</strong> dialog box. If your scheme is not selected, scroll up or down and choose your scheme. Test it by reading some of the lines of text on this page that have bold text. JAWS should read those words in a deeper voice. This makes it very easy to determine exactly which words appear in bold text.</p>
<h2 id="speech-and-sounds-training-mode">Speech and Sounds Training Mode</h2>
<p>Training mode helps you familiarize yourself with how the active scheme uses sounds to provide information. When training mode is on, JAWS announces detailed information for items, states, and attributes as well as the sounds assigned to them in the active scheme. You hear the sound, and then JAWS announces the same information you hear when using the Classic scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Training mode also announces information for items, states, and attributes that the active scheme ignores.</p>
<p>Since the sound assignments made by the scheme's creator may not be immediately obvious, training mode can help you determine the purpose of each sound. For example, if a scheme uses two different sounds to indicate the state of a check box, you might not be able to tell which sound indicates that the check box is selected. If training mode is on, JAWS plays the sound and then says, "checked" or "not checked."</p>
<p>To turn training mode on or off:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+ALT+S</strong>.</li>
<li>To turn training mode on, select Toggle Speech and Sounds Training Mode On and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. If you want to turn training mode off, select Toggle Speech and Sounds Training Mode Off and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>

<p><a href="_Surfs_Up_Start_Here.htm"><img src="images/Shark_Fin_50x50_New%20009.jpg" alt="Surf&#39;s Up" /></a></p>
<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="using-custom-labels">Using Custom Labels</h1>
<p>The Custom Labels feature is an extremely flexible and versatile way to customize Web pages to suit your individual needs. JAWS allows you to assign custom text labels to almost any HTML element that you can move to by pressing the <strong>TAB</strong> key. These elements include text links, graphic links, form fields, and buttons. You can also label images on Web pages. JAWS reads these custom labels instead of the identifying text assigned to the elements by the Web page author. JAWS also uses custom labels to identify elements when they appear in lists, such as the list of form fields that displays when you press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use this feature to customize the elements of any Web page to help you navigate the page, reduce verbosity, compensate for incomplete or poorly labeled elements, and similar functions. Redefine the labels for entire Web forms or applications so the names are more useful and meaningful to you. Customize Web pages so that links and graphics provide more information and help you find what you need right away. The Custom Labels feature provides unmatched flexibility in the way you read Web pages.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> JAWS saves the labels you assign to a Web page so they are available each time you use that page. In addition, the labels you create are applied to identical elements any time they appear in that page's domain. The domain is usually the first part of the page's Web address. For example, if you assign a label to a button, JAWS reads that label any time you encounter the button on any Web page within that domain. Custom labels are saved in JSI files in the Settings\Enu\PersonalizedSettings folder.</p>
<p>The following exercises demonstrate how you can use custom labels to make Web pages easier to use and more informative.</p>
<h2 id="labeling-an-image-map">Labeling an Image Map</h2>
<p>The image at the very top of the Customer Response Form depicts three tabs that users can click to navigate to other sections of the site. When JAWS reads this image, it says, "Graphic navigation tabs." This graphic is a special type called an image map. Image maps have one or more areas on them that act like links. Mouse users can click these areas, and JAWS users can press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate these links.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> The image map on the sample Customer Response Form is not coded to work well with JAWS. In this exercise, you'll use custom labels to make the image map easier to use:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <a href="Customer_Response_Form.htm">Customer Response Form</a> sample Web page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you hear JAWS announce "image map link tab2." The information provided by the page author is not very helpful in determining what this link actually does.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the link. The message that displays tells you what this link does. On a real Web page, the link would take you to another page without displaying the message. You would have to explore the site more thoroughly to discover what the link actually does.</li>
<li>After reading the message, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close this dialog box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Normally, if you follow a link to see what it does, you can return to the original page by pressing <strong>ALT+LEFT ARROW</strong>.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>. Select "Custom Label," and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to assign a custom label to this image map link.</li>
<li>Since this link takes you to the Products page, type "Products" and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to read the next image map link. This link also doesn't have a good description. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to find out what this link does.</li>
<li>After reading the message, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close this dialog box.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+TAB</strong>. This keystroke is a shortcut you can use to label an HTML element.</li>
<li>Since this image map link takes you to the Shopping page, type "Shopping," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> and then begin reading the page again. Notice that JAWS now reads the labels you assigned to the image map links instead of "tab2" and "tab3."</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>JAWS Tip:</strong> JAWS also uses the custom label whenever the element appears in an HTML list. Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong>. Notice that the labels you created are used to indicate the image map links in the list instead of "tab2" and "tab3."</p>
<h2 id="labeling-a-text-link">Labeling a Text Link</h2>
<p>Often times, the actual text of a link will not be very descriptive. You can use custom labels to change the text of a link. Use this feature to shorten wordy links or add more description to short links.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Follow along with the steps below to see how you can use JAWS to label text links.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <a href="Customer_Response_Form.htm">Customer Response Form</a> sample Web page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to display a list of links on the page. Find the link named "click here." That name isn't very descriptive. Select the link "click here" and choose <strong>Move to Link</strong> to go to the link's location on the page so you can find out more about it.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+NUM PAD 5</strong> to read the sentence this link appears in. From the context of the sentence, you can determine that the link allows you to send e-mail to the Webmaster.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+TAB</strong> to label this link.</li>
<li>Type <strong>"Send the Webmaster e-mail"</strong> without the quotes, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+NUM PAD 5</strong> to read the sentence again. Notice that JAWS reads your label instead of the words "click here."</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> again. The entry "click here" that was previously in the list has been replaced by "Send the Webmaster e-mail." Any time you assign a custom label, JAWS displays that label when the element appears in HTML lists.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the list of links when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="labeling-form-fields">Labeling Form Fields</h2>
<p>You can also assign custom labels to form fields and controls, such as edit boxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, check boxes, and buttons.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> In this exercise you'll assign custom labels to some unlabeled edit fields.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <a href="Customer_Response_Form.htm">Customer Response Form</a> sample Web page.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F</strong> to move to the first form field on the page. This form is poorly designed. Most of the fields are labeled incorrectly or aren't labeled at all. Press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong> to display a list of form fields. You can see that the majority of fields in this list are unlabeled.</li>
<li>Press <strong>E</strong> several times to move through the first three edit boxes on the page. JAWS announces the label for the first field as "full name" but the next two edit fields have no label. In reality, the first field should be labeled "first name," the second field should be labeled "middle initial," and the third field should be labeled "last name."</li>
<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+E</strong> twice to return to the first edit box, and then press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+TAB</strong>.</li>
<li>Type "First Name" and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to label this field. Assign meaningful labels to the other two edit boxes using the Custom Label command (<strong>INSERT+CTRL+TAB</strong>).</li>
<li>Press <strong>F</strong> until you hear, "Address." Press the <strong>TAB</strong> key four times and listen to JAWS announce each address-related field. See if you can determine the purpose of each field and then assign each a meaningful custom label.</li>
<li>When you've finished, press <strong>X</strong>. This command moves you to the first of three check boxes that you can use to indicate your level of customer satisfaction. Each check box is labeled with an image (a happy face, an indifferent face, and an angry face). Though the descriptions you hear for the check boxes are long, they are accurate and coded correctly. These particular descriptions come from the images' ALT text. In this case, the Web author primarily intended to use this ALT text to provide further information to sighted users when they move the mouse pointer over the image.</li>
<li>Use custom labels to shorten these verbose labels. Press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+TAB</strong>, type "Good," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>X</strong> to move to the next check box and give it the label "Fair." Then press <strong>X</strong> again and label the last check box "Poor."</li>
<li>Press <strong>E</strong> to move to an unlabeled multiline edit box. From the introductory paragraph and the initial text, you can deduce that this area is where you enter your comments. Press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+TAB</strong>, type "Comments," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong> to review all of the form fields on this page. JAWS displays all the fields using the custom labels you assigned to them. This form should be much easier to fill out now. Go ahead and fill out the form to see how you've used custom labels to greatly enhance its usability.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sharing-custom-labels">Sharing Custom Labels</h2>
<p>After you assign some custom labels to a page, you can share those labels with other users. Custom labels are saved in JSI files, just like personalized Web settings. To share your custom labels with other JAWS users</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the JAWS application window, press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu and press <strong>X</strong> to activate the Explore Utilities Folder option.</li>
<li>Navigate to Explore My Settings and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. A folder opens that contains all of the files you have had JAWS modify or create for you.</li>
<li>Select the folder PersonalizedSettings and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it.</li>
<li>Locate the JSI file with the domain name of the page that contains the custom labels you want to share. For example: "Google.com.jsi."</li>
<li>Copy this file and distribute it to others. Those you share your JSI file with need to copy the JSI file into their user folder on their computer following the steps above. They can now use that HTML page with your custom labels.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deleting-custom-labels">Deleting Custom Labels</h2>
<p>You can delete specific custom labels at any time, or you can delete all custom labels on a page. To delete an element's label, move to it with standard JAWS reading commands, the <strong>TAB</strong> key, a Navigation Quick Key, or a JAWS HTML list. Then, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Custom Label Delete," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. JAWS will now read the original identifying text instead of your custom label.</p>
<p>To delete all custom labels on the current page, press <strong>INSERT+F2</strong>, select "Custom Label Delete All," and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>

<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="using-search-engines-to-find-information-on-the-web">Using Search Engines to Find Information on the Web</h1>
<h2 id="search-engines">Search Engines</h2>
<p>Search engines on the World Wide Web are remotely accessible programs that let you do keyword searches for information on the Internet. There are several types of search engines and searches may cover titles of documents, URL's, headers, or full text. Keep in mind that the results you get from one search engine may not match the results you get from another search engine. In fact, they are often different due to the way each search engine behaves. Therefore, it may actually be beneficial to use more than one search engine on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In this section, we briefly look at Google and Yahoo!. Web pages are often dynamic and can change at any time. As a result, you may find that if either site changes, your experience with JAWS may be different than what is described here.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google</h2>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Use the link below to go to the Google web site and follow along with the instructions.</p>
<p>When you first go to the <a href="https://www.google.com">Google web site</a> there is a blinking cursor in the search edit box near the middle of the page. But you can also perform searches right from the address bar. To move to the address bar, just press <strong>ALT+D</strong>. Either way, as you begin typing, an autocomplete list may appear. You can press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the list and then <strong>ENTER</strong> to perform a search, or you can simply continue typing what you are searching for without using the list.</p>
<p>After you have typed in some text, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Search button. Results appear on the page below. We will discuss some techniques for finding the results on the page in a moment. But first, Google only returns web pages that contain all of the words in your query. If you find that you get too many "hits" or web pages that match your search, you can enter more words in your search query to narrow the choices.</p>
<p>Using good keywords gives you better results. Be as specific as you can. For example, a search for the keyword "musicians" will yield far more results than a search for the keywords "Elvis Presley." You do not need to include "and" between terms, but the order in which you type your keywords will affect the search results. You can also search for a specific phrase by including words in quotation marks. Google searches are not case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can also use the following items within your keywords for Google searches:</p>
<p>- (minus) sign. Causes Google to exclude a word from your search. For example, "JAWS" can refer to a screen reading software or a famous movie. You can exclude many of the movie-related hits by searching for "JAWS -movie." (Be sure to include a space before the minus sign and no spaces between the minus sign and the word "movie.") Searches for JAWS with different conditions yielded the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAWS, about 1,690,000,000 results</li>
<li>JAWS windows -movie, still yields about the same number of results, but you find much more information about JAWS screen reader and very little, if any, information about movies. There will most likely still be links to videos on YouTube or other sources.</li>
<li>"JAWS screen reader" (in quotes), about 49,600 results</li>
</ul>
<p>As you narrow your search and use better keywords, you get more relevant results. Putting a phrase into quotes tells Google to look for the exact words in that exact order.</p>
<p>Try typing different things such as names, phone numbers, and more to find people or things.</p>
<p>Try a search for Freedom Scientific. <a href="https://www.google.com">Use this link to go to the Google web site</a>. On the results page, there are a couple of things you can do to get more information about the results of the search:</p>
<ul>
<li>The statistics of your search are typically placed between the search edit box and the search results. You can use the JAWS find command <strong>CTRL+F</strong> to look for the word "Results," and then read that line. For example, when testing this, the search found, "About 203,000,000 results (0.80 seconds)." This can be useful if you need to narrow the search.</li>
<li><span class="highlightYellow">Google uses a "main" region to guide you to the search results.</span> You can press <strong>R</strong> to move from one region to another.</li>
<li>The items found as a result of your search are placed on the page as both links and headings. You can press the navigation quick key <strong>H</strong> to move quickly among the headings that match your search. Since they are also links, you can press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate them and move to those web pages of interest.</li>
<li>Below each heading (and link) that match your search is a short synopsis of what that page is about. After pressing <strong>H</strong> to move to a heading (link), just press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to read the text below it for more information.</li>
<li>Remember, you can also press <strong>SHIFT+H</strong> to move backwards.</li>
<li>There is also a good structure to the headings. The search results are typically listed after a heading level two. The matches found for the search are typically level three headings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Google uses regions to make navigation easier. Explore them by pressing <strong>R</strong> to move from region to region, and then press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move into the next section.</p>
<p>You can also read through the search results page using normal reading keys or use <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to open the list of links and see what related links were found. Use the <strong>Move to Link</strong> button in the links list, <strong>ALT+M</strong>, to move to a particular link and then down arrow through the associated text to find out if this might be what you are looking for.</p>
<p>In addition to the information displayed on the initial results page, there are often links to more pages of information that meet your search criteria. These pages are reached by activating the link for the number of the page. Usually you will find links for additional pages 2 through 10 near the bottom of each page, along with a Next link. Each page beyond the first page also contains a number of items that match your search.</p>
<h3 id="google-search-tools">Google Search Tools</h3>
<p>Google also provides easy-to-use search tools. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Weather Chicago" yields the current weather in Chicago</li>
<li>"25 kilometers in miles" converts kilometers to miles</li>
<li>"Define screen magnification" yields definitions for screen magnification</li>
<li>"Seafood restaurants 33716" yields restaurants that serve seafood in or near that zip code</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For both the Google web site and the Yahoo! web site discussed in the next section, be sure to check out the other links on their sites for Advanced Search, Help topics, and more.</p>
<h2 id="yahoo.com">Yahoo!.com</h2>
<p>Yahoo! is another search engine that many people use. The main Yahoo! page also has more information on it, such as sports and news headlines, entertainment links, and links to many other items. This tends to cause the page to appear more cluttered than the Google site, but may prove itself useful to you as well. As with Google, when you first go to the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo! web site</a> there is a blinking cursor in an edit box.</p>
<p>Forms mode comes on automatically when you get to a web page which has the focus set to a blinking cursor in an edit box. If for some reason forms mode does not come on automatically on your computer, you can also press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into forms mode, or you can press <strong>INSERT+F5</strong> to open the Select a Form Field dialog box for JAWS.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Mouse users can also click inside edit boxes and forms mode comes on automatically.</p>
<p>After you have typed in some text, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Search button.</p>
<p>Yahoo! behaves very much the same way as Google and displays a list of hits of matching items. These are links to further resources, and each link here also has a text description taken from that source that matches your query.</p>
<p>After a Yahoo! results page loads, press the letter <strong>H</strong> to move to the different headings on the page. Since the headings are also links, pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> on one takes you to the web page indicated. Beneath each heading/link is text that describes a little bit about that page. Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to use the list of links to explore the links, or you can also press <strong>TAB</strong> to move from one link to another.</p>
<p>To find the number of matches, use the JAWS Find and look for the word "results" without the quotes. You may have to use the function key <strong>F3</strong> to repeat the JAWS find. The results for Yahoo! are typically near the bottom of the page, so you may find the number of matches more quickly by pressing <strong>SHIFT+F3</strong> to search backwards.</p>
<p>Yahoo! also has links to other results pages, just as Google does. These links show as numbers 2 through 5, along with a Next link, and are located near the bottom of the page.</p>
<h2 id="going-beyond-the-search-engine-results-page">Going Beyond the Search Engine Results Page</h2>
<p>OK, so what happens when you choose one of the links you find on a search engine page? What strategies do you use to find the information you were initially searching for on the resulting page?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> All of the strategies you learned in this series of Surf's Up lessons, including:</p>
<p>Use <strong>N</strong> to jump past a series of links to move to the next block of text that has at least 25 characters without a link.</p>
<p>Use the list of links (<strong>INSERT+F7</strong>) to look for links that begin with specific words.</p>
<p>Use the list of headings (<strong>INSERT+F6</strong>) to look for structure in the headings on a page.</p>
<p>Use the JAWS Find to search for words or phrases on a web page.</p>
<p>Look for regions.</p>
<p>Use the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box (<strong>INSERT+V</strong>) to change things as needed such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop page refreshes</li>
<li>Search for &lt;title&gt; attributes, acronyms, abbreviations, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the Custom Label feature of JAWS to label unlabeled links or unlabeled form fields on pages that you visit often.</p>

<h1 id="using-html-help-systems">Using HTML Help Systems</h1>
<p>Help information for software is often presented in HTML format. You can read and navigate these Help systems just like Web sites on the Internet. A type of help system called HTML Help is used in many different kinds of programs, including JAWS. In addition to presenting information as HTML pages, an HTML Help system can also have an index, full text search capability, glossary, table of contents, and other features. In this section, you will learn how to use the comprehensive search and navigation features of HTML Help systems.</p>
<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>
<p>The table of contents is one of the best ways to browse the various subject matter contained in the Help system. A table of contents contains one or more books. Books contain several related topics.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> In the exercise below, you will use the JAWS Help system to learn how to navigate the table of contents.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the JAWS window, open the <strong>Help</strong> menu and choose <strong>Help Topics</strong>. Alternatively, just press <strong>F1</strong> from within the JAWS window.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>CTRL</strong> and press the <strong>TAB</strong> key until you hear "Table of Contents page." Notice that in the JAWS help there are four tabs in this pane: <strong>Table of Contents</strong>, <strong>Index</strong>, <strong>Search</strong>, and <strong>Favorites</strong>.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to explore the table of contents. As you move through the table of contents, you are moving through books or topics in a tree view. If a book is closed, you cannot see what topics it contains.</li>
<li>Select the book <strong>Using the Internet with JAWS</strong>, and then press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to explore the topics contained in the book you just opened. Sometimes, in addition to several topics, books can contain other books. When you press down arrow the first time you hear JAWS say, "Level one." If you continue to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> you will eventually hear JAWS say "Level zero" and the name of the next book below in the tree, which is closed. Level zero is the top level. As you open and close books and topics, JAWS announces when you change levels. As long as the level does not change when moving up or down, you do not hear the level repeated.</li>
<li>Select the book <strong>Navigating Web Pages</strong>, and press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the next level. JAWS tells you that you have moved to level two. You can think of these different levels as having a type of outline structure. Continue to press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you select the topic <strong>Navigation Quick Keys</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open this topic. The information it contains is displayed in the topic pane on the right side of the window.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F6</strong> to switch to the topic pane. JAWS automatically begins reading the text in the topic pane. You can use the standard JAWS reading and navigation commands to read this topic. You can use any command or feature that you can use normally with JAWS in a web browser, such as pressing <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to view a list of links, or <strong>H</strong> to move from one heading to another.</li>
<li>When you are finished reading you can press <strong>F6</strong> again to move back to the tree view of books and topics. <strong>F6</strong> is a command that switches between the two panes of the help window.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="index">Index</h2>
<p>The index of an HTML Help system lets you search by keyword. Indexes are useful for finding specific information about certain subjects.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> In this exercise you will use the JAWS help system to learn how to find information in an index.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In JAWS, open the <strong>Help</strong> menu and choose <strong>Help Topics</strong>. Alternatively, just press <strong>F1</strong> from within the JAWS window.</li>
<li>If you are continuing from the previous exercise, first make sure that focus is back in the tree view of books and topics. If you are not certain, press <strong>F6</strong> until you hear JAWS announce the tree view.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>CTRL</strong> and press the <strong>TAB</strong> key until you move to the <strong>Index</strong> tab page.</li>
<li>Let's assume you want to look up information about how to work with graphics. Type the word <strong>graphic</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the list of indexed keywords. The JAWS Help system has selected the closest matching keyword, which is "Graphic Label." This isn't the keyword you are looking for.</li>
<li>Use the arrow keys to explore the topics above and below the keyword you found. Then put the focus on the keywords "Graphics Labeler."</li>
<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> on "Graphics Labeler." There is more than one Help topic associated with these keywords. Press the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys to explore the topics.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Overview of the JAWS Utilities</strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>F6</strong> to move to the topic pane, and read the information about the topic.</li>
<li>Press <strong>F6</strong> to move back to the keyword entry box. Delete any word or phrase there, and then type <strong>cursors</strong>.</li>
<li>Next, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to that word in the list of keywords.</li>
<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to select the next keyword, which is "JAWS cursor."</li>
<li>Continue to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to explore these. They are subkeywords of the term "cursors." For example, JAWS cursor, PC cursor, and Virtual PC cursor. Subkeywords are used to provide more specific information about a broad or more general topic. For example, an index could have the term "Dogs" followed by the subkeywords "German Shepherd," "Golden Retriever," "Labrador," and so on.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="searching-the-help-system">Searching the Help System</h2>
<p>You can use a full-text search to find information on keywords that don't appear in the index or to find all topics where a certain word or phrase is used.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Next, you'll learn how to use the JAWS Help system's full text search feature.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In JAWS, open the Help menu and choose <strong>Help Topics</strong>. Alternatively, just press <strong>F1</strong> from within the JAWS window.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>CTRL</strong> and press the <strong>TAB</strong> key until you move to the Search tab page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are continuing from the exercise above you may need to press <strong>F6</strong> to move back to the left side of the window first.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Type the phrase, <strong>mouse pointer</strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the list of topics that contain the words you searched for. Make a note of how many topics are found. Use the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to explore this list. Notice that many topics were retrieved by the search. This is because the HTML Help system was looking for any topics that contained both of the two words contained in the first search. However, it was not looking to see if the words were next to each other in the text, or even if they were in the same sentence. It just found all topics containing both words at least once somewhere within each topic.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The search may also have found larger words that contain part of the text you search for. For example, the word "pointer" might be found as part of the plural "pointers."</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Press <strong>ALT+W</strong> to move back to the keyword entry box. Type quotation marks around the phrase "mouse pointer," and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to retry the search.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the search results list to view the results. Notice that about half as many topics were found this time. Select any of the topics found, and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Then, press <strong>F6</strong> to move to the topic pane so you can read the information.</li>
<li>To find out exactly where the phrase appears in the topic, press <strong>CTRL+F</strong>. Type the phrase in the JAWS find dialog box and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. Focus moves to a line of text that contains the current search phrase. You can verify this by reading the current line with <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong>. Press <strong>F3</strong> to move to each instance of the phrase and repeat the Say Line command to hear the new text that is found. For more information on the JAWS Find feature, read the prior Surf's Up lesson on using the JAWS Find Command.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="marking-favorite-topics">Marking Favorite Topics</h2>
<p>You can bookmark topics you need to refer to regularly so you do not have to always look for them in the table of contents or through a search.</p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE:</strong> Use the JAWS help system to add or remove a favorite topic.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In JAWS, open the <strong>Help</strong> menu and choose <strong>Help Topics</strong>. Alternatively, just press <strong>F1</strong> from within the JAWS window.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>CTRL</strong> and press the <strong>TAB</strong> key until you hear "Table of Contents page."</li>
<li>Select the book <strong>Using the Internet with JAWS</strong> and press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
<li>Select the book <strong>Navigating Web Pages</strong> and press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
<li>Select the topic <strong>Navigation Quick Keys</strong> and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open this topic.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> until you hear "Favorites Page." The title of the currently opened topic is displayed.</li>
<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Add button and press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. Focus moves to the list of bookmarked topics which now includes the Navigation Quick Keys topic.</li>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> to close the JAWS help and then reopen it.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> until you reach the "Favorites Page" and press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the list of bookmarked topics. The Navigation Quick Keys topic is still listed so you can press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it and then <strong>F6</strong> to move to the topic pane to read it. This saves you from having to navigate the table of contents to locate this topic each time you want to look up a navigation quick key.</li>
<li>To remove a favorite topic from the list, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Remove button and press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="printing-html-help-topics">Printing HTML Help Topics</h2>
<p>To print any topic in an HTML Help system, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the topic that you want to print in the table of contents, or find the topic using the index or search feature. Be sure to press <strong>F6</strong> to move to the topic pane before continuing.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CTRL+P</strong> to open the print dialog box.</li>
<li>Select the printer you want to use, as well as any other options available. Then press <strong>ALT+P</strong> or <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate the Print button.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="moving-back-to-the-previous-topic">Moving Back to the Previous Topic</h2>
<p>While browsing through an HTML Help system, you can do the following to return to the previous topic:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press <strong>ALT+O</strong> to open the <strong>Options</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Press <strong>B</strong> to choose Back.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> In JAWS Help, you can press <strong>ALT+B</strong> to move to the "Back" link at the bottom of each page. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to activate this link and return to the previous page. You can also press <strong>ALT+X</strong> to move to the "Next" link at the bottom of each page. Additionally, you can also press <strong>ALT+LEFT ARROW</strong> to move to a prior HTML help page or <strong>ALT+RIGHT ARROW</strong> to move forward.</p>

<div id="content" role="main">
<h1 id="aria-accessible-rich-internet-applications-live-regions">ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Live Regions</h1>
<p>A discussion in Surf's Up, in the Navigating Web Pages lesson, covered a component of ARIA regions that makes it easier to navigate Web pages where they are used. Another use for ARIA is to announce text that changes on the screen for screen reader users. This is done with "live regions."</p>
<p>ARIA live regions are used on pages that update frequently, such as stock tickers and chat logs. If the ARIA property value is not set to "off," JAWS automatically detects when the content changes and speaks all content of the region, or only that which changed, depending on how the Web page was set up. This enables you to hear items that change on the page without you losing your place and without having to move there.</p>
<p>Live region property values can be set to be off, polite, or assertive. The majority of the time, Web page authors will use the polite value. This, of course, depends on the priority of what is happening in that spot on the screen. If the value is set to <strong>polite</strong>, your screen reader should not be interrupted. Instead, you will hear the changes at the next opportunity, such as when you have finished reading or when you have paused typing. If the value is set to <strong>assertive</strong>, that means the new information has a high priority, and your screen reader *should* notify you immediately.</p>
<p>The section below this paragraph contains some short text that changes every ten (10) seconds. You do not need to move to the area where the text is changing to read it. JAWS will read it for you once you have paused whatever you are doing.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="LiveRegion1" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="false"></span></p>
<hr />
<p>The text just above this paragraph is the region that is set to change. In this example, all of the text on this part of the screen is replaced with new text each time, and all of the new text is spoken. However, some ARIA live regions may have text that stays the same as well as some text that does change. Do you want to hear all of the text in a region every time some of the text changes? Not always, but in some cases you do. Move on to the next page to get an idea of how this works.</p>

<h1 id="aria-live-regions---atomic">ARIA Live Regions - Atomic</h1>
<p>In this example, the ARIA live region contains some static text; that is, text that does not change, as well as text that does change. We present two fictitious baseball game scores. To keep it simple, only one of the scores will change, while the rest of the text remains the same. However, if all you heard was the number of the score itself, it would be difficult to tell which team had scored. The score for the Tampa Bay Rays is the score that changes on this page. It is set to update every ten (10) seconds. You do not need to move to the area where the text is changing. JAWS will read it for you once you have paused whatever you are doing.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="LiveRegion1" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><span id="teams">Tampa Bay Rays: <span id="LiveRegion2"></span><br />
Boston Red Sox:   5</span></span></p>
<hr />
<p>The text just above this paragraph is the region that is set to change. In this example, only the score for the Tampa Bay Rays changes on this screen.</p>
<p>Thanks to Charles Chen for allowing us to use the JavaScript found in these examples of ARIA.</p>
