Adobe Acrobat and Reader

Adobe Acrobat allows you to create documents in the Portable Document Format, or PDF. Many people use PDF documents to exchange information, because once a document is formatted in this way, its content and appearance are preserved. No one can change the document. To view or print PDF files, you can use Adobe Reader, which is available free of charge on the Internet. JAWS allows you to hear PDF files, primarily through use of the Virtual Cursor.

In order to take advantage of the many useful JAWS features designed for Adobe Acrobat/Reader, it is important that the PDF files are properly created and tagged by the document author. For information on creating accessible PDF documents, visit the Adobe Accessibility page.

Support for Accessible Java Applications

JAWS supports applications written with Oracles' Java Access API. When you move to a control within a Java application, JAWS automatically puts that control into the virtual buffer, making the application as easy to use as a Web page. JAWS speaks every accessible object available by using the Java Accessibility Bridge. In addition, you can even use a simulated JAWS cursor to navigate Java applications. JAWS can also announce position and level information in Java tree views, list views, and radio button groups and recognize ToolTips.

To use Java applications with JAWS, you must download and install both the Java 2 Platform and the Java Accessibility Bridge. You can obtain these files from the Oracle Web site. Beginning with the release of Oracle Java 1.7U6, the Java Access Bridge is included with the installation of Java. Therefore, if you already have Java 1.7U6 or later installed, then the Access Bridge is also installed. Otherwise, it is recommended that you update to the latest version of the Java 2 platform.

Note: Oracle may change their Web page layout periodically and may release newer versions of their software.

Edge

Edge is a web browser included in Windows 10. To use JAWS with Edge, you must be running the Windows 10 Creators update (version 1703) or later. While there are still several JAWS features that are not available in Edge such as PlaceMarkers, Smart Navigation, Flexible Web, and domain-specific settings, we have made the overall experience of navigating pages in Edge using both speech and braille as similar as possible to working in Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Firefox. As we continue to work with Microsoft to improve the Edge experience, future JAWS updates will include greater functionality.

The Virtual Cursor is used to read pages in Edge just like in other browsers. You can use the standard reading commands as well as most of the Navigation Quick Keys to navigate through pages. Currently, there are a few Navigation Quick Keys that are not yet supported in Edge, however the most used commands; moving by links, headings, paragraphs, forms, tables, lists, graphics, and regions, are available. More Navigation Quick Keys will be supported in future updates.

By default, JAWS uses Semi-auto Forms Mode in Edge, which turns on Forms Mode automatically only when you move to a form control using TAB or SHIFT+TAB. Due to the way Edge displays pages, Auto Forms Mode is not available as it is possible to have multiple controls on a single line. You will need to press ENTER to turn on Forms Mode if you use the ARROW keys to move to form fields.

Other familiar JAWS features that are currently supported include:

·         Displaying a list of links, headings, or form controls by pressing INSERT+F7, INSERT+F6, or INSERT+F5.

·         Searching for text on the current page by pressing CTRL+F.

·         Obtaining font information by pressing INSERT+F.

·         The ability for JAWS to detect changes in the language used on a web page and automatically switch to the appropriate voice if available.

Note: When configuring the High, Medium, or Low web verbosity levels in Settings Center, currently only the start and end announcements for regions can be turned off or on in Edge.

As you begin using Edge, one important item to note is that Edge is a Modern app with no menu bar that can be accessed using the ALT key. To access Edge specific features, press TAB from the bottom of a page or SHIFT+TAB from the top. Continue using TAB or SHIFT+TAB to move through the various controls until you cycle back around to the content area. Alternatively, Edge offers many of the same shortcut keys found in other browsers such as CTRL+T to open a new tab, CTRL+H for History, CTRL+I for Favorites, CTRL+J for Downloads, and so on. You can also press ALT+X to open a menu containing a number of options including Print, changing the zoom level, manage add-ons, Settings, and more.

PowerPoint

PowerPoint is a presentation package that allows you to create overheads, slide shows, and presentations. While PowerPoint is a visual presentation tool, JAWS commands make it possible to easily run presentations, create slides, and other documents such as organizational charts.

Due to the nature of PowerPoint, JAWS will often tell you information that is not actually displayed on the screen but which describes graphical concepts or animation effects that are apparent to the sighted user. Where possible, descriptive information uses the same language that is in the PowerPoint documentation. For example: the box on a slide where a title is entered is called a Title Placeholder. JAWS will announce this Placeholder even though there is no text on the screen that says the words, "Title Placeholder." Please visit http://www.microsoft.com for more information on PowerPoint.

Skype

This topic provides a brief overview of using JAWS with the Skype for Desktop application version 8.42 and later.

Skype allows you to make and receive audio and video calls as well as exchange instant messages with other users. For detailed information on using Skype and all of its features, visit the Skype website. This site also contains a complete list of hotkeys for Skype. You can also press INSERT+W to view a list of Skype keystrokes.

When downloading Skype, make sure to choose the link to get Skype for Windows, as this works for all Windows versions. There is also a Skype for Windows 10 which is a universal app as well as a Skype for Business. However, both of these apps do not work as well with JAWS at this time.

Answering and Ending a Call

When Skype alerts you to an incoming call, JAWS automatically speaks the caller information if the Skype window is in focus. The notification is also shown on the braille display as a flash message. You can also press INSERT+SPACEBAR followed by SHIFT+R to repeat the incoming call notification.

To answer an incoming call, perform the layered command INSERT+SPACEBAR, Y followed by UP ARROW or A. You can use these keystrokes from any application once Skype alerts you that someone is calling. Alternatively, use the layered command INSERT+SPACEBAR, Y followed by S to place focus in the Skype window and then press the Skype command CTRL+SHIFT+P or press TAB to move to the Answer or Decline buttons and press ENTER. If your computer has a webcam, you can press the Skype command CTRL+SHIFT+K to answer a call with video when the Skype window is in focus.

To hang up once you are finished with a call, perform the layered command INSERT+SPACEBAR, Y followed by DOWN ARROW or D. Just like answering a call, you can use these keystrokes from any application. Alternatively, use the layered command INSERT+SPACEBAR, Y followed by S to place focus in the Skype window and then press the Skype command CTRL+E.

Instant Messaging

If you are typing messages back and forth with another Skype user, JAWS automatically announces incoming messages as they are received if focus is in the Skype window. Incoming messages are also shown on the braille display as a flash message. To repeat the last background message, press INSERT+SPACEBAR followed by SHIFT+R. JAWS also provides additional keystrokes for use in conversations.

To review previous messages in the current conversation, press CTRL+INSERT+Y to move to the chat history list. Alternatively, you can move to the chat history using the layered keystrokes INSERT+SPACEBAR, Q followed by H. Use the UP or DOWN ARROWS to navigate the list of messages.

In an active conversation, press CTRL+INSERT+E to move to the chat entry field so you can begin typing a new message. Alternatively, you can move to the chat entry field using the layered keystrokes INSERT+SPACEBAR, Q followed by E.

To switch to a different conversation, press CTRL+INSERT+N to move to the conversations list. Alternatively, you can move to the conversations list using the layered keystrokes INSERT+SPACEBAR, Q followed by C.

Acrobat/Reader Getting Started

There are no special installation or setup requirements to run this product with JAWS. The accessibility wizard automatically starts when you start the program for the first time. This wizard helps you set up preferences that improve the accessibility of both the program and PDF documents. For additional information, refer to the product’s online help system as required, using ALT+H to select the software’s built in help topics. If you need assistance with JAWS commands or want to know what new features have been added that JAWS supports, use INSERT+F1+F1.

Acrobat/Reader Helpful Hints

Most PDF documents created in Adobe Acrobat are now accessible to JAWS. Use Adobe Acrobat or Reader to view and hear JAWS read these documents to you. Periodically you may encounter a poorly structured PDF file, which JAWS cannot access.

Virtual Features

When reading PDF documents, JAWS uses the Virtual Cursor just as it does in HTML documents. This means that you can use the same features you use to navigate Web pages when reading PDF documents. Useful features include Navigation Quick Keys, lists of tables, links, headings, and other elements, PlaceMarkers, HTML options, and many others.

The following topics contain information about JAWS HTML features that are also available in PDF documents:

Navigation Quick Keys Links
 Headings
 Images
 ListsForms
 Tables
 Elements
 PlaceMarkers
  HTML Options
  Focus Commands for Web Pages

For a list of many HTML keystrokes that you can also use when navigating PDF documents, see JAWS Commands for HTML.

Authoring Considerations

The accessibility of a PDF file depends on how the document was authored. While JAWS makes PDF documents far more accessible than ever before, some files may still not read properly. Information on authoring accessible PDF documents is available at http://access.adobe.com.

Content Delivery

If you find that PDF documents load too slowly, you can adjust the content delivery size of the document to load one page at a time, rather than loading the entire document all at once. To adjust your content delivery, open the Preferences dialog using CTRL+K, and then select the Reader page. On the Reader page, go to Content Delivery. Here you can set the minimum document size for loading a page at a time.

PDF Files on the Internet

JAWS supports PDF reading even when the file is opened within Internet Explorer. However, you may prefer to display PDF files opened from web pages with Acrobat or Reader. To configure Acrobat or Reader to open PDF files accessed from web pages:

1.    Press CTRL+K to open the Preferences dialog. When the dialog opens, you are placed in a list box containing several different selections.

2.    Press I until the Internet page opens.

3.    Press ALT+D to move to and clear the Display PDF in Browser check box.

4.    Press ENTER to accept the change and close the dialog.

PDF Forms

Auto Forms Mode, which is on by default, is a helpful feature when navigating a form's edit fields using either TAB or ARROW Keys. This means that it is not necessary to press ENTER to go into Forms Mode before typing text in an edit field. Also, you do not have to press ESC or NUM PAD PLUS to exit Forms Mode. This makes it far more intuitive and easy to interact with form fields without having to do these extra keystrokes. When you move to an edit field, you hear a sound indicating you can type at that moment without having to first press ENTER. When you exit the field, Forms Mode turns off and will let you easily continue to navigate in virtual mode again.

If you only want Forms Mode to activate when you move to an edit field using TAB or SHIFT+TAB, you can change to Semi-auto Forms Mode. If you do not want to take advantage of Auto or Semi-auto Forms Mode in a PDF form, you can change to Manual, which means you will have to press ENTER to activate Forms Mode in a form field.

To change between Auto, Semi-auto, and Manual Forms mode, press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings and then select the Auto Forms Mode option.

Creating Custom Labels

You can create custom labels for PDF form fields. JAWS announces this label when you move to or read the form field. This custom label replaces the label assigned by the document author (if any). For more information on creating custom labels for PDF forms, refer to Custom Labels.

Working with Text

Press INSERT+F if you want to hear the font and size of the text at the current location of the Virtual Cursor. Press this keystroke twice to display the information in the Virtual Viewer.

You can select text in a PDF document using the Virtual Cursor just as you can in HTML documents. For a list of text selection commands, see Windows Keystrokes for Working with Text. After you have selected some text, press the APPLICATION Key to display a context menu containing additional commands that you can perform on the selection (such as copying it to the Clipboard).

Tables

JAWS announces the start and end of tables as well as the number of columns and rows contained within each table. JAWS Table specific commands work within tables in PDF documents. For more information about using table specific commands, refer to Keystrokes for Working in Tables.

You can use Quick Settings (INSERT+V) to change how JAWS announces tables in PDF documents. The following options are available:

·         Lists Identify Start and End - This option controls whether or not JAWS identifies lists using start and end markings in the virtual cursor. When a list is identified this way, you see the following at its beginning: list of x items (nesting level y), where x is the number of items in the list and y is the level deep. There is not always a nesting level, but only when there is a list within a list. The end marking is List end, or List End nesting level y.

·         Table Show Start and End - This option controls whether or not JAWS shows start and end markings for tables in the virtual cursor. The start marking shows as follows: table with x columns and y rows, where x is the number of columns and y is the number of rows. The end marking is shown as follows: table end. If this option is off, you can still use Table navigation commands within tables, or quick navigation table commands to find tables.

·         Layout Tables - If this option is off, JAWS only detects data tables. If this option is on, JAWS detects all tables including navigation bars that appear st the top, bottom, or side of the Web page.

·         Table Titles Announcement - This option controls which titles JAWS announces as you navigate using Table commands within tables. Only the relevant title is read as you navigate the table. For example, as you move by row, only the row header is announced as it changes. The same is true when navigating by column. JAWS can say the row, title, or both row and title. If you select Off, no titles are announced.

·         Cell Coordinates Announcement - This options controls whether or not cell coordinates are announced when table navigation is used. When on, table cell coordinates are announced after the cell content.

Braille and PDF Files

JAWS now supports Structured Mode Braille when pressing TAB to move through links and/or form fields in PDF documents.

AudibleManager Getting Started

AudibleManager is the primary desktop program for listening to Audible.com content. It handles downloading, organizing, and transferring Audible content to a mobile device or CD. You can download titles immediately or create scheduled, automatic downloads of subscriptions as they are published.

AudibleManager also lets you customize how you view all downloaded content. You can transfer content to your supported mobile listening device, including MP3 players, PDAs, pocket PC devices, and the PAC Mate. You can also copy (or “burn”) content to audio CDs using your computer’s CD-RW drive.

Tip: If you need assistance with JAWS commands or want to know what new features have been added that JAWS supports, press INSERT+F1+F1. To get a list of Audio Manager shortcut keys, press INSERT+H. For optimal audio performance with JAWS, it is recommended that you use a sound card with multiple wave channels or a hardware synthesizer.

The AudibleManager window is divided into three panes: Audible Folders, Library, Mobile Device Programs, and Mobile Devices. Each pane is described in more detail below. To navigate among the panes, press F6 or the TAB key.

Audible Folders

This pane allows you to navigate through the folders that contain audio you have downloaded, new titles in your online library, and your daily, weekly, and monthly subscriptions.

The Audible Folders pane contains a set of folders that supports your personal audio library. These folders work just like folders in Windows Explorer or Microsoft Outlook. The default folders are described below.

Library

The Library folder contains your audio programs. This folder contains subfolders that show the details for downloaded or imported audio content stored on your computer. You can play your content by selecting the title and pressing CTRL+P or ENTER. You can also add it to a mobile device or to a CD burn list by pressing CTRL+T. Audible Desktop Player is the default player, but you can also choose to use either RealPlayer or Windows Media Player.

Tip: If you want to create an additional subfolder (for example, a folder called “Already Listened To”), press ALT+E to open the Edit menu and choose the Create Subfolder command. This allows you to better organize your audio as you listen. You can also move or copy titles between subfolders. Select the title in the Audible Inbox pane, press the APPLICATIONS Key, and choose either the Move or Copy command.

Trash

The Trash folder keeps a list of all titles that you have deleted from your subfolders. These files are not fully deleted from your computer until you empty Trash folder. To empty this folder, select the Trash folder in the Audible Folders pane, press the APPLICATIONS Key, and choose the Empty Trash command. You can also press CTRL+SHIFT+T to empty the Trash folder. If you want AudibleManager to delete files immediately or empty the Trash folder when you quit, open the Edit menu (or the Tools menu if you are using AudibleManager 4.x) and choose Options. Press CTRL+TAB to move to the Trash tab and select your desired options.

Subscriptions (AudibleManager 4.x only)

The Subscriptions folder allows you to set advanced properties for your subscriptions. A detailed explanation of these features is available in the AudibleManager Getting Started Guide. You can download this guide from http://download.audible.com/help/GettingStartedSubs.pdf or visit the Audible Support page and download the Getting Started Guide for subscriptions.

Tip: You can press CTRL+U in the Audible Folders pane to quickly move to and select the Subscriptions folder.

To retrieve your currently active subscriptions (also called synchronizing), select the Subscriptions folder in the Audible Folders pane. Press F6 to move to the Audible Inbox pane and then press CTRL+SHIFT+U to synchronize your subscriptions.

You can view and change the properties of any of your subscriptions. To do this, select the subscription in the Audible Inbox pane and press the APPLICATIONS Key. If you want to automatically download the latest issue when it is published, choose Latest Issue. If you want to download all back issues that you have not already downloaded, choose Download All Non-Downloaded Issues at Once.

Note: If you choose Download All Non-Downloaded Issues at Once, you may need to download a substantial number of back issues if you have not downloaded any issues from this subscription for some time. For example, if you haven’t downloaded three months of issues from a daily subscription, you will be downloading approximately 60 issues when the next issue is available.

New Individual Programs (AudibleManager 4.x only)

The New Individual Programs folder allows you to select single or multiple titles that are new in your library and download them without going online to the My Library area on the Audible.com Web site. You must be connected to the Internet to use this feature.

To download titles using this feature, select the New Individual Programs folder and then press F6 to move to the Audible Inbox pane. Select the title(s) you want to download and press the APPLICATIONS Key. Choose the Select for Download command from the context menu.

Tip: If you want to use a format other than the default, press the APPLICATIONS Key and choose Format.

After you select all the titles you want to download are choose the desired format, press the APPLICATIONS Key and choose the Download Checked Programs command. After a delay of about 30 seconds, AudibleManager begins downloading the titles.

Note: Depending on your connection speed, choosing more than five titles at a time may result in an incomplete download. If this happens, navigate to another folder and then return to this folder to refresh the Audible Inbox pane’s details. Repeat the process previously described and choose only five or fewer titles.

New Subscription Programs (AudibleManager 4.x only)

The New Subscriptions folder works the same way as the New Individual Programs folder, but downloads the latest issues of your active subscriptions. There is also a Renew button for recently expired Subscriptions. This button takes you directly to the Audible.com Web site so you can renew your subscription.

Library (Audio Inbox in AudibleManager 4.x)

This pane displays the contents of the currently selected folder in the Audible Folders pane. For example, audio content is displayed in this pane when you select a folder containing audio content. You can press CTRL+SHIFT+B to return to this pane at any time.

Tip: To select multiple titles in the Audible Inbox pane, first select a single title. Hold down CTRL and use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to move through the list. Press SPACEBAR to select the titles you want to include in the selection. Be sure not to press any arrow keys after releasing CTRL, or all the titles will be unselected.

Mobile Device Programs

This pane shows all of the programs loaded on the mobile device that is currently active. You can press the TAB key to move to the list of currently installed mobile devices.

Mobile Devices (Device Status in AudibleManager 4.x)

The Mobile Devices pane helps you transfer content to your mobile device or a CD. In AudibleManager 5.x, there are also options for no device and updating AudibleManager components.

Device Mode

Device Mode is active when a mobile listening device like an MP3 player, PDA, iPod, or PAC Mate is connected to your PC. To choose the active mobile device you want to use with AudibleManager, press CTRL+SHIFT+D and select your device in the Mobile Device Type combo box. This mode is generally used to transfer one audio title at a time from your desktop computer to your mobile device.

Tip: To use your PAC Mate with AudibleManager, choose Pocket PC in the Mobile Device Type combo box.

You can also use this mode to view and modify content on your mobile device. AudibleManager shows content currently on the mobile device and allows you to delete titles. You can also determine how much memory is available on your device or what is currently being used.

This mode also lets you switch between two views. You can view titles stored in the mobile device’s main memory or titles on the storage card. To switch between views, go to the Devices menu and select Choose Mobile Device or press CTRL+SHIFT+D. Select the radio button to indicate which view you want AudibleManager to display. You can also use this dialog box to switch to another mobile device, CD burning, or no device by making a selection in the Mobile Device Type combo box.

To delete audio from your device, select one or more titles and press DELETE. To erase all audio content from your mobile device, open the Devices menu and choose Erase.

CD Burning Mode

CD Burning mode is used to burn audio titles onto CDs with your computer’s CD-RW drive. These CDs can then be played in almost any audio CD player. For more information on burning CDs, refer to AudibleManager Helpful Hints.

Transfer List Mode (AudibleManager 4.x only)

Transfer List mode is similar to a playlist and allows you to queue multiple audio titles in a list. You can then transfer the entire list to a mobile device or CD. To switch to Transfer List mode, press SHIFT+T. You can quickly select all the content you want to transfer and add it to the transfer list by pressing CTRL+T.

Tip: If you select multiple titles in the Audio Inbox folder and press CTRL+T, AudibleManager switches to Transfer List mode and places the selected titles in the transfer list.

You can also choose to transfer a portion or segment of an audio program to your device. Select the title in the transfer list and press the APPLICATIONS Key. Choose Show Details from the context menu. This allows you to set the start and end times of the segment you want to transfer. You must specify both the hour and minute of the starting and ending times. This feature is useful if your device has memory constraints, but you still want to listen to multiple titles. This allows you to keep a few hours of several titles on your device at one time and then just refresh those portions you have listened to with new material as necessary.

AudibleManager Helpful Hints

Audible Sound Effects

AudibleManager has an optional component that you can install that plays sound effects when key functions start or finish. There are about 15 different sound effects. These sound effects play when:

·         You start or quit AudibleManager

·         A title finishes downloading

·         A portable device is connected or disconnected

·         A transfer of a title to a device starts or finishes

To enable this feature, open the Edit menu (or the Tools menu if you are using AudibleManager 4.x) and select Options. On the General tab, select the Enable Sound Effects check box and then press ENTER. AudibleManager will now download the sound effect component from the Internet and install it. The installation will close and then restart AudibleManager.

Burning CDs with AudibleManager

This section describes the process for burning CDs with AudibleManager. You can also visit the Audible Support page for more information about CD burning.

CD Burning mode lets you copy downloaded content onto a standard audio CD. This lets you listen to your Audible.com content on any CD player without the need for a mobile device. To switch to CD Burning mode, press SHIFT+B.

The first time you press this keystroke, you may receive a message that the CD Burn plug–in is not installed. You will then be asked to download and install this software from the Internet. You may need to restart your computer after this process. After the plug-in is installed, AudibleManager requires you to activate (register) your CD burner. The Activation Wizard will guide you through this process.

Perform the following to burn a CD:

1.    In the Mobile Devices pane, select "Go to CD Burn Mode" (if you are using AudibleManager 4.x, press CTRL+B).

2.    You must have a blank CD-R (write once) or CD-RW (write many times) disc in your CD-RW drive.

Note: Audible generally recommends using CD-R disks since CD-RW discs do not always play in all CD players and will typically take longer to create.

3.    Move to the Audio Inbox or other content folder and select the title(s) you want to put on the CD. Press CTRL+T to add the title to the list of titles.

4.    From the Devices menu, choose Start CD Burn.

5.    The CD Burn dialog displays, informing you of the length of the content that will be put on the CD and approximately how many additional discs you will need for the entire title to be transferred.

6.    Press ENTER to begin copying the titles to CD.

Note: The standard length of most CDs is about 74–77 minutes. At this time, Audible’s content providers do not allow you to burn MP3 formatted CD’s. Audio CDs created with AudibleManager are formatted using an industry standard called Redbook. This ensures that most CD players will be able to read and play these CDs.

Burning Additional CDs for Long Titles

Most audio books will require more than one CD for the entire title. After each CD is finished, a dialog box prompts you to continue to burn the next section of the title.

You do not need to burn all of the CDs at once. AudibleManager remembers that the beginning of the next CD starts where the last CD ended. To burn the next CD at a later time, simply follow the steps listed above, and AudibleManager will automatically remember the correct starting point based on the last CD you burned.

Note: Currently, only one title can be copied to an individual audio CD.

AudibleManager can also print CD labels that contain the title, author, and segment time of the audio on the CD, as well as an image of the book jacket. This feature requires CD label stock or paper.

Changing CD Burning Properties

AudibleManager currently supports two providers of CD burning plug-ins: Roxio and Gear. When and where you get your AudibleManager software determines which plug-in you can install.

Note: If you are unsure which plug-in you have, go to the Help menu and choose About.

To change the default CD burning properties, open the Edit menu and choose Options. Then press CTRL+TAB to move to the CD Burner Properties tab. If you are using AudibleManager 4.x, open the Tools menu and choose Change CD Burner Properties. The default burn speed for the Gear plug-in is one speed slower than your CD Burner’s highest supported write speed. This is to ensure that fewer overflow errors are encountered during the CD burning process. It is recommended that you leave the speed unchanged to reduce the chance of errors. However, if you are having no problems and wish to increase the speed, you can select a higher value. If you are having CD overflow problems (for example, you can begin the burn but it doesn’t finish) you should choose a lower speed.

Note: The Gear and Roxio plug-ins generally support about 90% of CD-RW drives. If you are having trouble with one of the plug-ins, you can contact Audible Customer Support and request a link for an AudibleManager installation that supports the other plug-in. This requires that you completely uninstall your existing AudibleManager software, since only one plug-in can be used at a time.

Using Expansion Memory for Mobile Devices

Most mobile device supported by Audible.com have expansion memory capabilities. This allows you to increase the device’s available memory. Expansion memory cards come in different formats, such as MMC, SD, CompactFlash®, Memory Stick®, and SmartMedia™. Check with your device manufacturer if you are unsure which kind of expansion memory your mobile device uses.

For example, the Otis mobile device comes with 64 MB of main memory. It also has a slot for SD or MMC expansion memory cards. You can add another 64 or 128 MB of expansion memory to the Otis, for a total 192 MB of memory. This allows up to 51 hours of Format 2 content or 27 hours of Format 3 content to be loaded at one time.

On most mobile devices, navigation between main memory and expansion memory is seamless. The Otis, for example, moves directly from main memory to external memory and then back to main memory.

Managing Programs and Files for Mobile Devices

To delete files on a mobile device:

1.    Connect your mobile device to your computer.

2.    Start AudibleManager.

3.    Switch to the Mobile Device Programs pane using the TAB key. Press CTRL+SHIFT+O.

4.    Use the arrow keys to select the program you want to delete.

5.    Press the DELETE key.

6.    Select Yes when the Delete Confirmation dialog box displays and press ENTER.

Tip: If you want to delete an additional title, you must press CTRL+SHIFT+O or use the TAB key to return to the mobile device contents pane.

To transfer a program to a mobile device:

1.    Start AudibleManager.

2.    Connect your mobile device to your computer.

3.    In the Audible Inbox, select the program you want to transfer to the mobile device.

4.    Press CTRL+T to start the transfer.

5.    Press ENTER on the OK button.

Using the Audible Desktop Player

Audible provides the Audible Desktop Player as an alternative to Windows Media Player and RealPlayer for listening to Audible content. This player has been optimized for accessibility and offers an easy-to-use interface with shortcut keys and audible prompts for rewinding and fast forwarding.

If you are using AudibleManager 4.x, you must download and install this player. To install the Audible Desktop Player, start AudibleManager, open the Tools menu, and choose Select Desktop Player. Press ALT+D to select the Audible Desktop Player radio button and then press ENTER. AudibleManager will install the program automatically. You must establish a connection to the Internet before installing the Audible Desktop Player.

Follow the instructions provided by AudibleManager to complete the installation. When you play a title in AudibleManager, the Audible Desktop Player will be your default player for Audible content only. The Audible Desktop Player can continue to play content while you work with other programs, even if you close it.

Tip: For more information on AudibleManager refer to the help topic AudibleManager Getting Started.

Sections

Audible content is often divided into sections that allow for easier navigation within an audio title. A section can be a chapter, article, or story. For example, each article in the New York Times is a section, so you can skip any articles you don’t want to read. Sections may also be the length of a standard audio tape or CD, which are the sources of most audio books that Audible produces.

To go to the next section, press CTRL+SHIFT+F. To go to the previous section, press CTRL+SHIFT+R.

Bookmarks

Bookmarks allow you to mark places in Audible content that you want to return to at a later time. Press CTRL+B to place a bookmark at the current location. You can view a list of all bookmarks by pressing CTRL+G. Use the arrow keys to select a bookmark and press ENTER to move to the corresponding location within the title.

Shortcut Keys

Below is a list of the available shortcut keys for the Audible Desktop Player.

Corel Presentations Getting Started

JAWS will only support Corel Presentations 9.0 if Service Pack 4 or higher is installed. Refer to the software’s online help system as required, using ALT+H to select the software’s built in help topics. If you need assistance with JAWS keystrokes or want to know what new features have been added that JAWS supports, use INSERT+F1.

Corel Presentations Helpful Hints

SlideShow Mode

Slide Edit Mode

INSERT+F1

Object Creation Mode

Object Text Edit Mode

Read Slide Text

SlideShow Mode

JAWS does not provide meaningful feedback when you run a slide show. We recommend that you prepare your notes in an alternate format.

Slide Edit Mode

While working in Slide Edit mode, use the TAB key to move between objects and press ENTER to edit an object’s text.

INSERT+F1

Press INSERT+F1 to hear useful information regarding what is expected by Presentations. For instance, INSERT+F1 may tell you the current mode in which you are working or the tool that you are using.

Note: JAWS commands for Corel Presentations are not available from within the Virtual Viewer. Press ESC to exit the Virtual Viewer before entering JAWS commands.

Object Creation Mode

If you are working in object creation mode, you can move the tool to a location on the slide and drop the selected object there. Use the arrow keys to announce the tool’s position. The units of measure are in WP Units by default, and are relative to the bottom left side of the slide. To change the unit of measure spoken by JAWS to Points, use Quick Settings, by pressing INSERT+V. Select the appropriate option, and the setting is retained, even if you exit Presentations.

Object Text Edit Mode

If JAWS does not read the text in the object text edit mode, adjust the screen font size using the Zoom dialog, which you can find on the View menu.

In Corel Presentation 10, ALT+TAB moves your focus from the Writing Tools Dialog to the Object Text Edit Mode. However, you cannot use this same command to move the focus back to the Writing Tools Dialog. JAWS provides a new command, ALT+INSERT+TAB that moves the focus back to the last Writing Tool that you were using. This keystroke only works if the current focus is on the Object Text Edit Mode screen.

Read Slide Text

To read text on a slide, use the Say All command, INSERT+DOWN ARROW. When you are at the Slide Edit Level, you will not find the cursor on the text when you stop reading, because there is no cursor.

Goldmine Helpful Hints

JAWS uses a memory buffer of information from the active window to make speech flow more smoothly. If it seems as though JAWS may be skipping characters or words while reading, press INSERT+ESC. This command refreshes the memory buffer so JAWS can read the screen correctly.

In Goldmine version 4.0, use a dark background color to optimize JAWS’ performance with Goldmine. Changing the background color will change the color of the field labels and data of your records, so that you can use the JAWS keystrokes to Select a Page and to Read Field Labels.

Warning: For Goldmine 5.0 or higher, do not change the background color. Leave the default background for the best results with JAWS.

Follow these instructions to change the background color:

1.    Open the Edit menu by pressing ALT+E.

2.    Press the DOWN ARROW key to navigate to the Preferences menu item or press the letter F.

3.    In the Preferences multi-page dialog, press CTRL+TAB to display the Record page. You should hear JAWS speak something like, "Appearance bright background radio button checked."

4.    Use the UP ARROW key to change it to dark background.

5.    Press the TAB key to move to the OK button and press ENTER.

Navigating Web Pages

JAWS uses the Virtual Cursor on web pages, letting you read as you would in a word processing document. The Virtual Cursor is also available in other applications, such as HTML based help systems, HTML based e-mails in Outlook, and in PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Many of the features discussed within these topics are also available wherever the Virtual Cursor is used. For specific information on what features are available, refer to the JAWS help topic for the application you are using.

Reading and Moving Through Web Pages

When you open the browser, your home page opens. If you don't have a home page specified, you can select a web page from your Favorites menu, or press ALT+D to move to the Address Bar and type in the address of a page. Once a page is selected, it is loaded and JAWS announces the presence of links, headings, forms, regions, frames, and more. Then, JAWS begins reading the text on the screen from top to bottom. To move through the page, use UP and DOWN ARROW, PAGE UP, and PAGE DOWN as you would in a word processing document. The JAWS commands to Read By Word, Line, Sentence, and Paragraph work normally.

Note: If you start to read before a page finishes loading, some of the page may not be available.

JAWS says, "link," when it encounters a link to another document or portion of the page. To follow a link, press ENTER while positioned on the link. For more information about using links, refer to HTML links.

To go back to the previous page, press ALT+LEFT ARROW or BACKSPACE. To move forward one page after you have moved back, press ALT+RIGHT ARROW.

Quick and Easy Navigation

JAWS provides easy to use and remember commands to move through web pages. Press a single letter on your keyboard and move right to an item. For example, you can press T for table, F for form control, V for visited link, H for heading, and so on. Add SHIFT to move to the previous element of that type. For a complete listing of these commands, visit Navigation Quick Keys.

Displaying Lists of Information

JAWS can look at a web page and compile lists of paragraphs, links, headings, form fields, and other elements so you can quickly find what you need and move to information. Press INSERT+F3 to open the Virtual HTML Features dialog box. This dialog box allows you to choose from a variety of lists containing information about different types of elements on the current page. Select an item and press ENTER to view a list of all those elements.

You can also use the following commands to quickly display lists of the following important HTML elements:

·         Form Fields - Press INSERT+F5

·         Headings - Press INSERT+F6

·         Links - Press INSERT+F7

·         Frames - Press INSERT+F9

In addition, if you hold down CTRL+INSERT and press one of several Navigation Quick Keys, JAWS displays a list of those elements on the current page. For example, to display a list of check boxes on the current page, press CTRL+INSERT+X. For a complete list of keystrokes that display lists of elements, refer to Navigation Quick Keys.

Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to move through the lists and select items. Alternatively, press the first letter of an item to move right to it. Press ENTER to move to the selected item's location on the page.

Interacting with Forms

JAWS lets you easily work with forms on the web. Press F to move to the next form control on the page or SHIFT+F to move to the previous form control on the page. Press ENTER to manually enter Forms Mode. Press TAB or SHIFT+TAB to move between form controls while in Forms Mode. Type in edit fields, check check boxes, and select items from lists and combo boxes. Press NUM PAD PLUS or ESC to exit Forms Mode.

You can also configure JAWS for Auto Forms Mode. JAWS will automatically enter and exit Forms Mode as you move through a form field. For more information about forms, visit HTML Forms.

Smart Navigation

Today and in the future, users will be faced with an increased need to work with complex web forms, tables, and even applications that run inside of a web browser. This will impact your day to day interactions with online services such as banking and shopping, in addition to many web apps found in both companies and government agencies. Smart Navigation™ offers a more efficient way to navigate in web-based applications with the Virtual Cursor, as the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW or CTRL+LEFT and CTRL+RIGHT ARROW commands move by control instead of character and word. This makes navigation such as moving across toolbars, tab strips, and navigation links more like navigating around a desktop application. Pressing the Say Character, Say Word, or Say Line commands twice quickly changes to the traditional navigation by character, word, line, sentence, and paragraph so you can review the text of the control. Smart Navigation resumes when you move to a different control by pressing UP or DOWN ARROW or TAB. Alternatively, you can use the INSERT+X command to quickly toggle Smart Navigation on or off depending on the type of website you are navigating.

For example, if you use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to move across a tab strip, you might hear JAWS announce something like: "Home tab selected," "Insert tab," and "Page Layout tab." If you wanted to review the items on the tab strip character by character, press the Say Character (NUM PAD 5), Say Word (INSERT+NUM PAD 5), or Say Line (INSERT+UP ARROW) commands twice quickly. You can now navigate by character or word until you press DOWN ARROW to move away from the tab strip to another control.

Smart Navigation offers the following three modes:

·         Controls: Controls, including, but not limited to, buttons, links, edit fields, list boxes, and tree views, are treated as single units when navigating by character or word, like moving through a menu bar with RIGHT and LEFT ARROW. Performing a Say Character, Say Word, and Say Line command twice quickly while focused on a control will switch to character and word navigation so you can use the traditional navigation by character, word, line, sentence, and paragraph to review a control, such as the text of a button or link, in greater detail. Smart Navigation by controls automatically resumes when you move to another control using TAB or UP or DOWN ARROW. If you encounter a table, you will still use the table reading commands (CTRL+ALT+ARROW keys) or the Table layer (INSERT+SPACEBAR, T) to navigate the table.

·         Controls and Tables: Similar to the Controls option except that if focused inside of a table, the RIGHT and LEFT ARROW keys move between columns while the UP and DOWN ARROW keys move between rows. If you press RIGHT ARROW to move from the last column in the current row to the first column of the next row, or LEFT ARROW to move from the first column in the current row to the last column in the prior row, JAWS plays a sound to indicate the new row. When focused in a cell and it contains any controls, such as a link or an edit field, pressing the Say Character, Say Word, or Say Line commands twice quickly will switch to control navigation, and performing these commands again twice quickly will switch to character and word navigation. If the cell does not contain controls, you can only switch to character and word navigation. Moving focus away from the current table cell using LEFT or RIGHT ARROW will switch back to the prior navigation level, for example, pressing RIGHT ARROW while in character and word navigation will return to Smart Navigation in tables as soon as you move to a different cell.

·         Off: Navigating by character or word in virtual documents works as it always has in JAWS. This is the default setting.

To turn on Smart Navigation, there are a few ways.

The quickest way to enable Smart Navigation is through the Startup Wizard which automatically launches after JAWS is installed. It can also be launched at any time by selecting Startup Wizard from the JAWS Help menu. When the wizard starts, select the Next button until you reach the Common Options page. The focus will be on a group of radio buttons where you can use the ARROW keys to choose the Smart Navigation option you want to use (Controls and Tables or Controls). Pressing TAB moves you to another group of radio buttons that allow you to select how Forms Mode activates. For the best experience with Smart Navigation, it is recommended that users set Forms Mode to Semi-Auto or Manual. This prevents JAWS from unexpectedly turning on Forms Mode while navigating with the ARROW keys. Once you have changed the options you want, continue selecting Next until you reach the Braille Settings page, and then select Finish to save your changes. Smart Navigation will now be enabled for any environments that use the VirtualCursor.

Alternatively, Smart Navigation can be configured through Settings Center or Quick Settings. For instance, you may want to use Smart Navigation in Firefox, but not in Chrome.

You can also temporarily toggle Smart Navigation on or off using the INSERT+X command. This command will toggle Smart Navigation between Off and the Smart Navigation option that is currently selected in the Startup Wizard. This means that if the default selection is Off, or Controls and Tables, pressing INSERT+X will toggle between Off and Controls and Tables. If the default selection is Controls, pressing INSERT+X will toggle between Off and Controls.

An example of when you might use this command is if you have configured Smart Navigation to be enabled by default and you encounter a web page where you would prefer not to use it, you can press INSERT+X to turn it off and use the more traditional navigation. JAWS will switch back to Smart Navigation when focus moves away from the browser or you navigate to a different website. This command is also useful if you do not want to use the Say Character, Say Word, or Say Line commands twice quickly to switch to standard navigation. It offers the additional benefit of not automatically switching back to Smart Navigation when you move to a different control with the UP or DOWN ARROW keys. You can just press INSERT+X again to toggle back to Smart Navigation when you are ready. As Smart Navigation is toggled, the JAWS focus will always remain at the current location on the page.

Anytime you are using Smart Navigation, JAWS will work in Screen Layout. This presents pages in the virtual buffer similar to how they appear visually on the screen. Toolbar buttons or other lists of controls that are visually laid out horizontally on the screen are displayed on one line in the virtual document, allowing a single press of the DOWN ARROW to skip the entire toolbar instead of having to move from button to button to get past it.

When Smart navigation is active, pressing ALT+DELETE or INSERT+TAB announces the current Smart Navigation level. In addition, as you navigate by line, JAWS plays a sound if the current line contains one or more links that would generally be displayed on separate lines when Smart Navigation is off. This sound helps you identify that a link exists and gives you a chance to move to it using TAB or the ARROW keys. To keep this sound from being too intrusive, it is not heard if a line contains a link that is preceded by less than five characters such as a bulleted or numbered list that contains a link directly after the number or bullet.

General HTML Hints

Favorites Menu

The Favorites menu is available in most web browsers. This menu allows you to save the addresses of sites you like, so that you can return to them later. The Favorites menu also allows you to organize your list of websites into folders and subfolders.

History

The History window lists the pages you have recently visited. To toggle the status of this window, press CTRL+H. When the History window opens, it displays a list of visited sites. Navigate to the page you want to visit and press ENTER to open it.

Jump to Line

You can use JAWS to quickly jump to any line of an HTML page. Press J to display the Jump to Line dialog box. This dialog box shows the number of lines available and the line number of your current location on the page. Enter the line number you want to jump to and press ENTER. You can return to your previous location on the HTML page by pressing SHIFT+J.

Tip: Occasionally, certain lines in an HTML page may change, such as when you press INSERT+CTRL+ENTER on an image with the OnMouseOver attribute and an expanded menu displays. When an HTML page is updated, JAWS announces the line number where the change occurred. Press J and enter the line number to jump to the new content. You can press SHIFT+J to return to your previous location on the page.

Address Bar

Every Web page has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which serves as the address of the page. For example, the URL for the Freedom Scientific page is http://www.FreedomScientific.com. The Address Bar shows the URL of the Web page you are viewing. To read the Address Bar, press INSERT+A. To move to the address bar, press ALT+D.

Selecting Text on a Web Page

To select text on a Web page, use the standard Windows commands for selecting text, for example, SHIFT+ARROW Keys, CTRL+C, and so on. Note that the Select and Copy option defaults to Full Content Using Onscreen Highlight. This means that when using Internet Explorer, text is highlighted as it would be in a text editor or word processing application. The Say Selected Text command (SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW) speaks the selected text.

Open Context Menu at Virtual Cursor Location

Context menus present options for handling pages, links, and images. To open a context menu at the Virtual Cursor location, press NUM PAD STAR.

List Internet Explorer Toolbar Buttons

The buttons on the Internet Explorer Toolbar present options for moving to recently visited pages, favorites, or working with the current page. To open a list of these buttons, press INSERT+F8.

Conventional Mode

The Virtual Cursor provides the most functionality when working in HTML documents, and makes it easy to browse the Internet and locate information. However, if you wish to turn off the Virtual Cursor and work in conventional mode, press INSERT+Z. To permanently turn off the Virtual Cursor, clear the Use Virtual PC Cursor check box in the Miscellaneous group in Settings Center.

Read Window Title

When you use the Read Window Title command, INSERT+T, within Internet Explorer or other HTML document, JAWS reads the heading of the section of the page you are in, the name of the frame you are in, and the window title.

Buttons in Web Forms

Select the information JAWS speaks for buttons found in forms on Web pages. JAWS can use Title text, Screen text, ALT text, the Value attribute, the longest string of information, or a custom search string. Screen text is the default. To temporarily set what is announced for buttons, press INSERT+V and use the Buttons Show Using option. To set this option permanently, use the Miscellaneous options in the Web/HTML/PDFs group in Settings Center.

Virtual Cursor in Web Dialogs

The Virtual Cursor also moves through many web based dialogs. This provides the same functionality as on a web page. For example, in Internet Explorer, select Help, About (ALT+H, A).

Tabbing Through Text

A web page author can specify the TAB order for various elements, including textual elements such as paragraphs and headings. When you press TAB, JAWS moves between and reads any HTML element that has its TAB order specified. JAWS first moves through those elements with a specified TAB order, and honors the specified order. Then JAWS moves through links and form controls with no specified TAB order, in the order they appear on the page. You cannot TAB to textual elements with no TAB order specified.

Graphics as Buttons

A web page author can make an image act as a button, even if the image is not part of a form control. JAWS includes such images regardless of the HTML Graphics Options setting. However, you cannot TAB to these graphics like you can TAB to actual form buttons.

Acronyms and Abbreviations on Web Pages

JAWS can read Title text associated with acronyms and abbreviations on web pages. To enable this feature, open Settings Center and expand the Web/HTML/PDFs group. Next, expand the Reading group and use the abbreviation and acronym options

Navigation Quick Keys

Navigation Quick Keys make it faster and easier to move around on a web page and anywhere else the Virtual Cursor is active. These commands are all assigned to keys on the main part of the keyboard, and are easy to remember and use.

Tip:  You can use the SHIFT key in combination with many of the keystrokes in the table below to move to the previous unit or element.

The following table describes the Navigation Quick Keys available for web browsers and Adobe Acrobat Reader. You can always change the current keystroke value using the Navigation Quick Key Manager.

HTML Navigation Quick Keys for Say All

Many of the Navigation Quick Keys are also available while using Say All on a web page. The commands to move by heading, paragraph, form control, table, list, same or different element, step out of an element, and to move to non link text all work when Say All is used.

Quick Keys Settings

Navigation Quick Keys are on by default, but you can turn them off, or set them to work only within Say All. Press INSERT+N to toggle this setting. You can also change this setting temporarily in Quick Settings, INSERT+V. To make a permanent, open Settings Center, expand the Keyboard group, and select Navigation Quick Keys. For more information, refer to:

HTML Links

Links allow you to move from one portion of a document to another or from one document to another. Most programs underline the text of links and displays different colored text for visited and unvisited links. When reading a Web page with the Virtual Cursor, JAWS places each link on its own line, even if the document visually presents the link on a line with other text or additional links.

Moving to Links Link Announcement

 Links List Dialog
 Moving to Any Link

Moving to Links

·         To move through the links on the page, press TAB for the next, and SHIFT+TAB for the prior link. These commands cycle through all links.

·         To move through visited links, press V for the next, and SHIFT+V for the prior visited link.

·         To move through unvisited links, press U for the next. and SHIFT+U for the prior unvisited link. These commands do not move to same page links because they are never considered unvisited.

·         To open a link, press ENTER. To force the link to open in a new window, press SHIFT+ENTER.

·         To skip past a series of links, press N. JAWS moves to the first text of at least 25 characters that is not a link. To move to the text above a series of links, press SHIFT+N.

Link Announcement

When you move to a link with the Virtual Cursor, JAWS announces the type of link and the text of the link. JAWS announces the type of link as follows:

·         Link: This indicates a link that has not been visited.

·         Visited Link: This indicates a link that has been visited. This is determined by your browser history, not by which links have been selected on the current Web page. If you clear the History List, the links are no longer announced as visited.

·         Same Page Link: This indicates a link that moves you to another location on the same page.

·         Send Mail Link: This indicates a link that opens a new e-mail message using your default e-mail program. The To field of the new e-mail is already filled out, and the Subject field is sometimes filled out as well.

·         FTP Link: This indicates a link that points to a FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server. Usually, these links are to files, and when you select them, the browser displays a dialog asking if you want to save the file to your computer.

JAWS announces when a graphic is used as part of a link. Image Map Links are also announced. Image map links are part of an image. A small section of the image is mapped out to represent a "hot spot" that is normally clicked with the mouse. JAWS moves to image map links the same way it does to other links. For more information, refer to Graphics and Links.

JAWS provides configuration settings for links, so you can determine what information and how much information you wish to hear:

·         By Default, JAWS speaks the on screen text of a link, but you can set JAWS to instead speak Title text, assigned by the page author within the HTML code. Title text normally provides supplemental information about the link.

·         By default, JAWS announces the link type, but you can disable this, so JAWS announces same page links, send mail links, and ftp links as "link," or "Visited Link."

Change these settings temporarily in Quick Settings, INSERT+V. Change these settings permanently using options in the Links group in Settings Center. For more information, refer to:

·         HTML Options

·         Web/HTML/PDF Group

Filter Duplicate Links

JAWS can filter duplicate and consecutive Web page links so that only the text link is announced. This is useful when a graphic link and text link, which both point to the same URL, appear side by side on a Web page. Hearing duplicate links can be both confusing and annoying to novice and experienced JAWS users. Use the Filter Consecutive Duplicate Links check box (available in Settings Center and Quick Settings) to toggle this feature on or off.

Links List Dialog

Use the Links List Dialog to quickly locate and select links on a web page. Press INSERT+F7 to open the Links List. Press UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW, or the first letter of a link's text to move through the list of links, and press ENTER to open a link.

You can also move through the controls in this dialog by pressing TAB. There are buttons to move to the location of a link on the page or to open a link. There are radio button groups to filter and sort the links that display in the list. There are also access keys for all these controls, so you can select the options without leaving the list of links.

  ---------------------------- ------------
  Setting                      Access Key
  Move to Link                  ALT+M
  Activate Link                 ALT+A
  Sort Links in TAB Order       ALT+T
  Sort Links Alphabetically     ALT+P
  Display All Links             ALT+L
  Display Visited Links Only    ALT+V
  Display Unvisited Links       ALT+U
  ---------------------------- ------------

Tip: While in the list of links, press INSERT+PAGE DOWN to read the status bar. JAWS reads the web page address for the current link.

Moving to Any Link

JAWS offers a navigation option that can manually be assigned to a Navigation Quick Key for use in all browsers to move to any link. To assign a key to this action, do the following:

1.    Press INSERT+F2, then select Navigation Quick Keys.

2.    Select Any Link from the list and then choose the Edit Key Assignment button.

3.    In the edit box, type the key you want to assign to this option and press ENTER. The key must be A through Z or 0 through 9.

4.    Choose OK to save your change and close the dialog box.

Once this item is assigned, it will move the Virtual Cursor in a browser to both visited and unvisited links.

HTML Headings

IN HTML, headings are used to indicate the start of sections and subsections of a page. When viewing all headings on a page, if the headings are used properly, the hierarchy of the heading levels indicates how the page is structured. This makes it easier to find information and understand the relationships within the information.

JAWS recognizes headings at levels 1 through 6. Press H to move to the next heading, or press SHIFT+H to move to the prior heading. To view all the headings navigation commands, refer to Commands for Headings.

JAWS Headings List Dialog

The JAWS Headings List dialog (INSERT+F6) lists headings on the current page, and indicates the heading level. Move to a listed heading in the Headings List with the arrow keys, or type the first few letters of heading text to move to it. Press ENTER to move to the selected heading within the web page.

Press ALT plus the number of the heading level (1 through 6) to display only headings at that level. Press ALT+L to display all headings.

To list headings in alphabetic order, press ALT+P. To list headings in TAB order, press ALT+T.

Heading Announcement

When you navigate to a heading while reading a Web page, JAWS says, "Heading," and then indicates the heading's level, followed by the text. If you move to a heading by pressing H, JAWS reads the text followed by the word "heading" and the heading's level.

To temporarily turn off heading announcement, press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings and select Heading Announcement. Press SPACEBAR to cycle through the available settings.

To permanently change this setting, from within Internet Explorer or any other HTML-based application, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center (INSERT+F2), select an application in the Applications combo box, and then expand the Web/HTML/PDFs group.

2.    Select and expand the Headings and Frames group, and then select Indicate Headings.

3.    Select either No Headings, Headings Only, Headings with Level, Play Sound, or Speak Heading Using Voice.

4.    Choose OK to save changes and close Settings Center.

HTML Authoring Considerations

The HTML heading navigation features are extremely useful on pages that use headings as they are intended. However, many web pages are written that do not properly use headings. The heading navigation features may not be as useful on these pages. For information about proper use of HTML and other Internet related technologies, please refer to www.w3.org/wai, the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative.

HTML Images

Images are often used to enhance the appearance of a web page, and can also serve as icons, buttons, links, and backgrounds of pages.

Text Equivalents for Images

HTML attributes are used to provide text to accompany images. When used correctly, this text provides information which allows you to gain a better understanding of the images and what purpose they serve. JAWS cannot read information from the actual image, but JAWS does read this accompanying text.

·         The "Alt" attribute is used to include a brief description of an image. JAWS reads this text when it is available.

·         The "Title" attribute is used to provide supplemental information about an image. JAWS reads title text if alt text is not available.

·         The "Longdesc" attribute is used to provide a long description of an image on a separate page. If JAWS announces that there is a long description press ALT+ENTER to open the page containing the long description in a new window.

JAWS HTML Graphics Settings

JAWS provides settings so you can determine which graphics are announced, and what information is read.

Set JAWS to announce all graphics, only tagged graphics, or no graphics. By default, JAWS reads only "tagged" graphics. Graphics that contain no alt or title text are ignored. Graphics that include a "null" or empty alt text value are ignored even if you have JAWS set to announce all graphics.

With JAWS set to read all graphics, if no alt or title text is included, JAWS reads the file name of the graphic.

Set the order in which JAWS looks for information about graphics. JAWS reads the first information found. Set JAWS to first look for alt text, title text, the longest string of information, a quoted string of text from an "onmouseover" attribute, or specify a custom search order for information about graphics.

To temporarily change the type of information JAWS provides about images, use Quick Settings. To change it permanently, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center, and type "For an Image" without the quotes in the Search edit box.

2.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to For an Image in the filtered results of the tree view in Settings Center.

3.    Press F6 to move focus to the configuration display pane, and then use ARROW keys to move through and select one of the Speak radio buttons.

4.    Press F6 to return to the tree view.

5.    Press TAB to move to the OK button and activate it by pressing SPACEBAR. Changes are saved, and Settings Center closes.

For more information about HTML images and options, refer to the following topics:

·         HTML Options

·         Web/HTML/PDF Group

Graphics and Links

When JAWS encounters a link which includes a graphic, it says, "link graphic" followed by the alt or title text. If no alt or title text is available, JAWS reads the file name of the image.

Sections of images are often mapped out by coordinates and used as links. JAWS says, "image map link" when it encounters these links. If no text accompanies the link, JAWS reads a portion of the address of the target page.

JAWS can be set to announce all graphic and image map links, only those that are tagged, or to ignore all graphic and image map links. These settings are adjusted temporarily in Quick Settings, or set permanently using options in the Links group in the Web/HTML/PDFs group in Settings Center.

Background Images

Web pages sometimes use images as backgrounds. JAWS cannot provide information about background images because HTML provides no way to associate a textual equivalent.

HTML Lists

Within HTML, lists are used to present information in several ways. Knowing when items are presented in a list and what type of list is used can help you to understand the relationships within the listed information.

·         Bulleted lists present items which are not sequential, such as a list of choices.

·         Numbered lists present items sequentially, such as a step-by-step procedure.

·         Definition lists present lists of terms with their definitions, such as a glossary.

Press L to move to the next list. Press SHIFT+L to move to the previous list. To move to the next item within a list, press I. Press SHIFT+I to move to the previous item in a list.

Bulleted Lists

When JAWS encounters a bulleted list, it announces "list of x items," x being the number of items in the list. JAWS says "bullet" before reading each item in the list.

Bulleted List Example

·         Coffee

·         Tea

·         Milk

Numbered Lists

Numbered lists are often used to present step-by-step instructions. When JAWS encounters a numbered list, it says "list of x items," x being the number of items in the list. JAWS reads the number preceding each item followed by the text of that item.

Numbered List Example 1

1.    Step 1.

2.    Step 2.

3.    Step 3.

Numbering in lists may not always begin with the number 1. Lists are sometimes interrupted and resumed later on the page.

Numbered List Example 2

This list resumes from the example shown above.

4.    Step 4.

5.    Step 5.

Letters or Roman numerals can be used instead of numbers in these lists. JAWS reads the appropriate letter or number preceding each list item.

Definition Lists

JAWS says "definition list of x items" when it encounters a definition list. JAWS reads each term and places an equal sign between the term and definition.

Definition List Example

Access Key

Underlined letter on a menu or command used for quick access to that item.

Check Box

A small box with a brief text label. Press SPACEBAR to check or clear the check box, which sets or clears the option.

Combo Box

A box from which you choose from standard choices.

Nested Lists

A list which is included as an item in another list is called a nested list. Nested lists are often used to create outlines. JAWS announces the nesting level of each list.

Nested List Example

I.     Major topic in an outline

II.    Second major topic

A.   Subtopic

1.    Point 1

2.    Point 2

B.   Subtopic 2

III.  Third major Topic

Turning Off Announcement of Lists

If you wish to turn off the announcement of lists temporarily, use the Web Verbosity options in Settings Center. For more information, refer to Web/HTML/PDF Group.

HTML Forms

HTML forms on Web pages allow you to enter information and send it to another computer. Examples of forms include shopping carts, feedback forms, and Web-based e-mail and bulletin boards.

Web based forms are collections of controls such as you would find in a Windows dialog. Check boxes, combo boxes, edit fields, and radio buttons are all found on Web pages.

Forms Mode Overview – Manual, Auto, and Semi-auto

Forms Mode is a function of JAWS that lets you type text into edit fields or select combo box values on Web pages and Adobe Acrobat forms.

Manual Operation 

When using Navigation Quick Keys to jump to a form control, such as F for next form field or E for next edit box, JAWS uses Forms Mode manually by default. This means that when you move into an edit field or combo box control, you must press ENTER so that you can type text in that field or scroll through and select a value. To manually exit Forms Mode, press NUM PAD PLUS or ESC. Manually controlling Forms Mode may be better suited for experienced JAWS users.

Tip: If Forms Mode is on and you use the Say Line (INSERT+UP ARROW) or Say All (INSERT+DOWN ARROW) commands in an edit box, JAWS reads all the text on the current line. This may include text that is not inside the edit box, such as a label or description.

Automatic Operation

JAWS automatically enters Forms Mode when you move to an edit field or combo box using the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys, or when you move to an edit field using the ARROW keys. This is known as Auto Forms Mode. It means that you can freely type in the edit field without having to press ENTER first. When you exit the control, Forms Mode turns off. This functionality can be very useful for new and sighted JAWS users. By default, Auto Forms Mode is on. It can be changed using the INSERT+V command, or the options in the Forms Mode group in Settings Center.

Semi-auto Operation

Semi-auto Forms Mode is very similar to Auto Forms Mode except that it will only activate when you move to an edit field or combo box using the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys. Moving to edit fields using the ARROW keys will not automatically turn on Forms Mode. This is useful for more experienced users who still want the benefit of Auto Forms Mode, but they do not want it to activate while navigating with the ARROW keys.

For information describing how to customize Forms Mode, such as adding audible sounds that indicate when you enter and exit an edit field, refer to the help topic Forms Mode Group.

Moving through Forms

With the Virtual Cursor on, press CTRL+INSERT+HOME to move to the first form field. To move to the next form field, press F. To move to the previous form field, press SHIFT+F. To move to the last form field, press CTRL+INSERT+END.

Press INSERT+F5 to get a list of form fields on a page. Select an item from this list and press ENTER to move to a specific field. JAWS automatically activates Forms Mode for the item, allowing you to enter information or make a selection.

You can also use the following Navigation Quick Keys to move to specific types of form controls on the page:

·         Press A to move to the next radio button.

·         Press C to move to the next combo box.

·         Press E to move to the next edit box.

·         Press X to move to the next check box.

Hold down SHIFT before pressing a Navigation Quick Key to move to the previous form control of that type. In addition, if you hold down INSERT+CTRL  and then press one of these keys, JAWS displays a list of all form controls of that type that are on the page. Select a form control from the list and press ENTER to move to it.

TAB Order

Authors of Web pages can specify the TAB order for form controls by using the "Tabindex" HTML attribute. JAWS moves through the controls in this specified order when you press TAB or SHIFT+TAB to move through the form. If the "Tabindex" attribute is not assigned to all fields, JAWS first moves through the items with a "Tabindex" assigned, then moves through the other form fields and links in the order they appear on the page.

Check Boxes and Radio Buttons

To check a check box or radio button without entering Forms Mode, press SPACEBAR or NUM PAD SLASH when the Virtual Cursor is on the item. If you are on a checkbox, the state of the checkbox is toggled. If you are on a radio button that is unchecked, the radio button is checked.

Combo Boxes

If you enter Forms Mode in a Combo box, the first item is selected. To change the selection, press UP or DOWN ARROW.

Tip: In some forms, changing the selection in a combo box opens a new page automatically. To work with these combo boxes, press ALT+DOWN ARROW to open the list of choices, Then move to an item and press ENTER to make your selection.

Multiple Selection

To make multiple selections in a list box, press TAB to move into the list box. Press SHIFT+F8 to move into Multi-Select mode. Use UP and DOWN ARROW to move through the list, and press SPACEBAR to make your selections. Press SHIFT+F8 again when you are finished.

Form Control Prompts

JAWS attempts to associate each form field with a textual prompt. JAWS can identify when a prompt is specifically associated with a control, and speaks the correct prompt when you move to that control. If no prompt is specifically associated with a control, JAWS attempts to identify text positioned near the control as the prompt. This is most accurate when the text is directly above or to the left of the form control.

Label Element

The author of a Web page can use the "Label" element with the "For" attribute to assign a prompt to a specific form field. JAWS reads this label when you move to the associated form field.

Fieldset and Legend Elements

The "Fieldset" element is used to group form controls in the same way as a group box groups controls within a dialog box. The "Legend" element gives these groups of controls a name. JAWS reads the legend as you move to each form control within the "Fieldset" with TAB, SHIFT+TAB, or form control specific navigation commands such as F.

Authoring Considerations

Forms on some Web pages are not written with accessibility in mind, and JAWS cannot obtain enough information to read the form controls properly. If JAWS does not read form controls correctly while you are in Forms Mode, reading the form with the Virtual Cursor may provide additional helpful information. Press ENTER to turn Forms Mode on and fill in a form field. Then press NUM PAD PLUS to exit Forms Mode and continue reading the form with the Virtual Cursor.

HTML Tables

Tables are made up of columns and rows with information placed inside table cells. Tables may be used in one of two ways. Data tables display relationships between types of information. Layout tables position information on the page or define the general layout of a page, such as in newspaper columns. By default, JAWS detects data tables and indicates that a table contains x number of columns and y number of rows when you enter one. JAWS also gives you verbal indication when you reach the end of a table. These settings can be changed in the HTML Options dialog on the Lists and Tables page.

Reading and Moving within Tables

JAWS provides commands which allow you to move around within tables and from one table to another as well as get information about the position of table cells and the structure of tables on a page.

When you move to a table, JAWS announces the number of columns and rows, and reads the summary, if a summary is available. When you navigate tables using standard reading commands, JAWS reads the cells in order from left to right and behaves as if each table cell begins on a new line. JAWS does not identify table headers or provide information about table structure as you navigate the table in this manner.

To move to the next table, press T. To move to the previous table, press SHIFT+T. The Virtual Cursor moves to the contents of the first cell in the table, and JAWS reads the table summary, if present, and the contents of the table cell.

Tip: To display a list of all tables on the current page, press CTRL+INSERT+T. Use the arrow keys to select a table from the list and press ENTER to move to it.

To jump directly to a cell within the current table, press CTRL+WINDOWS Key+J (or WINDOWS Key+J if you are using Mozilla Firefox). Enter the column and row number of the cell you want to move to and press ENTER. To return to your previous location in the table, press SHIFT+CTRL+J (or SHIFT+WINDOWS Key+J if you are using Firefox).

To hear information about the current table cell, press ALT+CTRL+NUM PAD 5. JAWS announces the row and column position, reads the current row and column headers, and reads the contents of the cell. To read from the beginning of the row to the current cell, press INSERT+SHIFT+HOME. To read from the current cell to the end of the row, press INSERT+SHIFT+PAGE UP. Similarly, you can press INSERT+SHIFT+END to read from the top of the column to the current cell, or press INSERT+SHIFT+PAGE DOWN to read from the current cell to the bottom of the column. To read the current column, press INSERT+SHIFT+NUM PAD 5.

When you move to the next or prior cell in the same row using table navigation commands such as ALT+CTRL+RIGHT ARROW, JAWS reads the column header and the data in the cell and announces the column number.

When you move to the next or prior cell in a column with ALT+CTRL+UP ARROW  or ALT+CTRL+DOWN ARROW, JAWS reads the row header and the data in the cell and announces the row number. If the number of columns changes when you move to a new row using these commands, or when using WINDOWS Key+ALT+UP ARROW or WINDOWS Key+ALT+DOWN ARROW to read the prior or next row, JAWS states the number of columns in the new row.

To move to the first cell in the table, press ALT+CTRL+HOME. To move to the last cell, press ALT+CTRL+END. JAWS reads the contents of the cell, announces the row and column number, and then reads the row and column headers.

To select an entire table, use F8. For more information, see HTML Elements.

For more information about commands for reading tables, refer to:

·         JAWS Specific Keystrokes

·         Navigation Quick Keys

Row and Column Headers

Table headers provide information about the data contained in each column and row. If table headers are used, JAWS reads them as you move through the table using table navigation commands such as ALT+CTRL+RIGHT ARROW. When you move to a cell in a new column, JAWS reads the header for that column but does not read the row header. When you move to a cell in a new row, JAWS reads the row header but not the column header. The Table Titles setting in Quick Settings allows you to specify that JAWS should ignore column headers, row headers, or provide no information about table headers.

Note: JAWS does not identify row or column headers when you navigate tables using standard reading commands with the Virtual Cursor or using Say All.

Table Summary

The table summary provides information about the purpose of the table. If a summary is provided, JAWS says, "Summary," and reads the summary text.

Table Caption

Table captions provide information about the nature of the table. JAWS reads the text of captions.

Layout Tables

Obtaining information about layout tables may provide you with a better understanding of the structure of a page. To specify that JAWS should provide information about layout tables, set Layout Tables to On in Quick Settings or in the HTML Options Dialog choose All Tables in the Detect Table Type combo box on the Lists and Tables page.

Nested Tables

A table may be included within a table cell, creating nested tables. JAWS announces the nesting level of each table.

HTML Tables and Braille

JAWS allows you to determine how much information is displayed on your refreshable braille display for tables on Web pages. There are many settings in the Braille Options group in Quick Settings (INSERT+V) to configure what information JAWS displays in braille. Some that you may use frequently include:

·         Table Display: Set JAWS to display the current cell, the current row, or the current column. The default is to display the current cell.

·         Table Title Reading: Set JAWS to display row headers, column headers, both row and column headers, or turn off display of row and column headers. The default is to display row headers.

·         Table Show Coordinates: Set JAWS to display table cell coordinates or turn them off. This setting is enabled by default.

If JAWS is configured to display either the current row or current column, the vertical bar symbol (dots 1-2-5-6) will be displayed between cells to help indicate where one cell ends and the next begins.

If the current row is being displayed, JAWS will display the current column number before the cell where the cursor is located. In addition, if JAWS is configured to speak column headers, the header for the current column will also be shown in braille following the column number and prior to the cell containing the cursor.

Similarly, If the current column is being displayed, JAWS will display the current row number before the cell where the cursor is located. In addition, if JAWS is configured to speak row headers, the header for the current row will also be shown in braille following the row number and prior to the cell containing the cursor.

HTML Frames

Frames display multiple web pages at the same time by splitting the browser window into several panes, each displaying a separate page. The frames on a page may be arranged vertically, horizontally, or mixed so that, for example, one frame appears on top with two frames side by side below it. In this way, frames provide structure visually on a page and allow text on one portion of the page, such as a listing of navigation links, to remain the same while another portion changes. JAWS provides commands that allow you to navigate easily on a page with frames.

To move to the next frame, press M. To move to the prior frame, press SHIFT+M.

Note: The JAWS script MoveToFrameByNumber allows you to move directly to the first through tenth frame. By default, this script is not assigned to a keystroke. If you want to use this feature, you can assign this script to a keystroke in the Keyboard Manager.

To open a list of frames, press INSERT+F9. Press UP and DOWN ARROW to move through the list, or press the first letter of a frame. To move the cursor to the location of the selected frame, press ENTER. To close the list, press ESC.

By default, JAWS does not announce the beginning or end of frames. To change this, use the Web Verbosity options in Settings Center. For more information, refer to Web/HTML/PDF Group. When enabled, JAWS reads the frame title if one is available. If no frame title is available, JAWS reads the frame name.

Inline Frames

Inline Frames are embedded directly within a web page and display the contents of another page. Inline frames are often used to display advertisements. You can set JAWS to temporarily ignore inline frames in Quick Settings. Press INSERT+V, move to Inline Frames, and press SPACEBAR to toggle the setting. You can also use Settings Center by expanding the Web/HTML/PDFs group, expanding the Heading and Frames group, and then using the Ignore Inline Frames check box.

HTML Elements

Web pages are written in HTML. HTML elements are like the features in a word processor that tell the web browser how to display information. Everything displayed on a web page is an element. The type of element determines how something is displayed and what it is. Paragraphs, headings, tables, lists, and links are all examples of HTML elements.

Some elements are used hierarchically, representing the relationship of information on the page. For example, a table is made up of several elements which signal the beginning of the table, define a table row, place information inside a cell within a row, etc.

Attributes are used to modify HTML elements, what they do, to provide more information, or to change how the element is displayed in a web browser. Alignment, borders, access keys, alternate text, and title text are all provided with attributes. To learn more about HTML, visit the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative.

Move by Element

At times you may wish to skip over an entire part of a web page. JAWS provides commands to move to the next or prior HTML element. Move either to the next or prior instance of the same type element, or to the next or prior instance of a different element. For example, use the Next Different Element command, D, to move past a list.

  ------------------------- ----------
  Description               Command
  Next Same Element          S
  Prior Same Element         SHIFT+S
  Next Different Element     D
  Prior Different Element    SHIFT+D
  ------------------------- ----------

Select Entire Element

JAWS provides a command that allows you to select an entire part of a web page, select an entire table, or select an entire list. To select an entire list, move to the line that reads, "List with x items," and press F8. The list is selected and ready to be copied to the clipboard. To select an entire table, move to the line that reads, "Table with x columns and y rows," and press F8. When selecting a table and copying it to the Clipboard, the table formatting is lost. Information from each cell of the table starts on a new line.

Note: What is selected is based on where the Virtual Cursor is located, so it is important to move to the beginning line of a list or table if you want to select the entire list or table. For example, if the Virtual Cursor is on a list item, rather than at the top of the list, only that list item is selected.

Step Out of Element

JAWS lets you step out of an element, such as a table or list, so you can move around more quickly. Press > to step past the current table, list, or other element. Press < to step before the current table, list, or other element.

Display Element Information

If a page is not designed clearly, obtaining information about HTML elements may help you to understand the layout of the page. Now, view basic or advanced HTML element information. Press INSERT+SHIFT+F1 to view basic HTML element information. This includes the assigned attributes and their values for the current element and the element directly above it in the HTML page hierarchy. For example, if you use this command while an image within a link is highlighted, JAWS provides all information on both the image and the link.

Press CTRL+INSERT+SHIFT+F1 to receive advanced HTML element information. This includes the assigned attributes and their values for the current element and the elements directly above it in the HTML page hierarchy. For example, if you use this command while within a table, you receive information for the table data cell, the table row, the table, the body of the HTML page, and the HTML document element.

This information comes directly from the HTML source code for the web page, and is very useful. For example, on a page with a series of graphical links, where the graphics are labeled with alternate text of "Image One," "Image Two," and "Image Three," these commands would provide more information about each graphical link. This would include the file name of the pages to which each link leads, and that could help you determine what is on each page.

Miscellaneous Elements, Attributes, and Features

HTML uses elements to mark text as a certain part of a page. Paragraphs, lists, headings, tables, even links are elements. Attributes are used to modify what HTML elements do, to provide more information, or to change how the element is displayed in a web browser. Alignment, borders, access keys, alternate text, and title text are all provided with attributes. To learn more about HTML, visit the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative (www.w3.org/wai).

Access Keys in HTML

JAWS announces access keys assigned to HTML elements using the HTML "Accesskey" attribute. Access keys let you move directly to an item such as a link or form control. Access keys are used within the JAWS help system to provide quick access to the Back and Next links within most topics, which make it easy to move through the help system. Press ALT+B to move to the back link, and press ALT+X to move to the next link. Access keys assigned to links only move you to the link. For example, after pressing an access key to move to a link, you must still press ENTER to select it. Access keys assigned to buttons actually activate them.

If you do not wish to hear access keys within web pages, you can turn off this feature in Settings Center using Speak Access Keys within Web Pages check box in the Web/HTML/PDFs group. For more information, refer to the Web/HTML/PDF Group.

Mouse Over Effects

HTML allows the author of a page to set an OnMouseOver attribute for most HTML elements to run specified code such as JavaScript or Visual Basic Script when the mouse pointer is moved over the HTML element. Often this is used to momentarily display text, graphics, or links. JAWS now recognizes the OnMouseOver attribute, and if it is set to display text or links as part of the page, JAWS provides access to that information. Press INSERT+CTRL+ENTER to simulate moving the mouse pointer over the element at the Virtual Cursor location. If the mouse over event caused some part of the page to change, JAWS announces the line where the change occurred. To review the new content, you can press J to perform the Jump To Line command. Enter the number of the line that changed and press ENTER to move directly to that line. You can press SHIFT+J at any time to return to your previous location on the page.

By default, JAWS announces when an HTML element has a mouse over effect. If you want JAWS to ignore the OnMouseOver attribute, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center (INSERT+6) and expand the Speech and Sound Schemes group.

2.    Select the Select Speech and Sounds Scheme option, and choose Classic from the list.

3.    Select Create/Modify/Delete Schemes and press SPACEBAR to open the scheme's dialog box.

4.    Choose Edit Selected Scheme.

5.    Press CTRL+TAB until you move to the HTML page, and then use the arrow keys to select "onmouseover."

6.    Press ALT+I to select the Ignore radio button.

Tip: If you want JAWS to play a sound when you encounter an element with a mouse over effect, press ALT+P to select the Play Sound radio button. Then, choose Select Wave File to select a sound.

7.    Choose OK and press ALT+A to save your current settings as a new scheme. Give the scheme a descriptive name and press ENTER. JAWS will not announce the OnMouseOver attribute while you are using this scheme.

Click Almost Anything

HTML allows the author of a page to set an OnClick attribute for most HTML elements to run specified code such as JavaScript or Visual Basic Script when clicked with the left mouse button. To access these items, move to the item and press ENTER.

Dynamically Edit HTML Text

The "Contenteditable" HTML attribute is used to make almost any text dynamically editable. JAWS now supports this attribute, but does not announce its presence. If the attribute is set to true for an element of text, press ENTER to enter Forms mode, edit the text, and press NUM PAD PLUS to activate the Virtual Cursor again.

Adobe Flash 

JAWS now reads information from Flash animations as easily as any other part of a web page. Select links, activate buttons, and type within edit fields just like on any web page. Flash animations are presented as part of the page, and JAWS announces when you enter and exit the animation. Flash can also be ignored by JAWS on web pages by selecting the Ignore Flash on Web Pages check box in the Web/HTML/PDFs group in Settings Center.

Stop Web Pages that Automatically Reload

JAWS announces "Page will refresh in X seconds," when you open a page set to automatically refresh. Some web pages are configured to automatically refresh, or reload, every so often. When this happens, JAWS starts over reading from the top of the page. This makes it very difficult to read these pages. Now, set JAWS to prevent these pages from reloading. Use Quick Settings, INSERT+V, to set this option temporarily, or change it permanently in Settings Center using the Page Refresh Filter in the Web/HTML/PDFs group.

Active Content, web content provided by ActiveX controls, applets, and Flash animations that support MSAA, can also be set to automatically refresh. You can also set JAWS to suppress refreshes of active content - temporarily in Quick Settings.

Font Information

JAWS now reports font information within web pages when you use the INSERT+F command. Press INSERT+F twice quickly to open this information in the JAWS Virtual Viewer.

Quotations

JAWS now notifies you when you enter or exit a quotation that uses the "blockquote" HTML element. If the HTML "Cite" attribute is used to supply the Web address source of the quotation, this information is also spoken.

MathML

MathML is a language for including mathematical content on web pages, enabling browsers to present math and science equations and formulas as they would appear on paper. JAWS provides spoken, natural language descriptions of MathML expressions in Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox using the same terms a teacher would use to explain them in a classroom. Students will benefit from hearing JAWS describe mathematical expressions as their teachers and peers do. If a refreshable braille display is connected, JAWS also shows math expressions on the display using the Nemeth Braille code, a widely used system for reading math in braille. In addition, math expressions are also displayed with highlighting in the Math Viewer as they are spoken so sighted teachers can assist students that are using JAWS to study math.

Note: Since Nemeth Braille is a system exclusive to English, MathML content can currently only be shown in braille if JAWS is configured for one of the English Contracted Braille output modes.

Once JAWS is installed, you can immediately begin reading math and science content. You do not need to install any additional third-party software applications or plugins to use JAWS MathML support.

When you encounter MathML on a web page, JAWS describes the expression, followed by the message "math content." If you are using a braille display and JAWS is configured for Contracted Braille, the message "Math" is displayed followed by the expression. If the expression is too long to fit on the display, you can use the panning buttons on your display to view the rest of it. Otherwise, if JAWS is set for Computer Braille, the message "Math" is displayed followed by a message stating that Contracted Braille must be enabled to view math content. Pressing ENTER while focused on the math content opens the Math Viewer where you can explore the expression in greater detail in both speech and braille by doing the following:

·         To move between parts of the expression, use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys.

·         To focus in on a partial expression, press DOWN ARROW.

·         To return to the whole expression, press UP ARROW.

·         To read all the partial expressions at the current nesting level, press INSERT+UP ARROW.

·         To read the current partial expression, press NUM PAD 5 or INSERT+NUM PAD 5.

·         From within the Math Viewer, press ESC or ALT+F4 to exit.

Additionally, the contents of the Math Viewer are displayed visually on the screen. As the equation is navigated, the current expression or partial expression is highlighted so a sighted assistant can easily tell what part of the expression is being spoken.

When using a braille display, the entire expression remains on the display as you use the ARROW keys to navigate parts of the expression. However, the cursor (dots 7 and 8) moves to the start of the partial expression that gains focus. Pressing a cursor router over a term in the expression will immediately move the cursor to the specific location and cause JAWS to speak and visually highlight the partial expression as if you moved to it with the ARROW keys.

If you are viewing an expression containing a table, JAWS indicates in both speech and braille the number of columns and rows in the table. When the table gains focus, press ENTER to go into Table Navigation. In Table Navigation, the UP and DOWN ARROW keys move between rows while the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys move between columns. Press ENTER on a table cell to enter Equation Navigation so you can explore the current cell. Press ESC to return to Table Navigation, and then once more to return to Equation Navigation for the whole expression.

JAWS supports MathML included directly in HTML in Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox. In addition, JAWS supports MathML content rendered by MathJax in Internet Explorer. MathJax is a popular JavaScript library used by web developers to provide a consistent look and feel for math content across browsers.

On certain sites, such as Wikipedia, math is displayed as a graphical image which is not readable by JAWS. However, in the case of Wikipedia, you can specify that the MathML that generated the graphic is included directly in the HTML of the page. Making this change requires you have a Wikipedia account. Creating an account is free, but the process includes a captcha which will require sighted assistance, or the WebVisum add-on for Firefox, to complete. Once logged in, go to your advanced preferences and select "MathML with SVG fallback" to render math in HTML.

Visit the MathML Examples page To experience JAWS and MathML support in action.

Visit the Math section of the World Wide Web Consortium Web site (www.w3c.org/math) for more information about MathML.

PlaceMarkers

A PlaceMarker is a bookmark that you can easily add to a web page, HTML, PDF, or Word document, or form to mark a location. This is useful when you want to return to commonly used areas on a web page, important sections or paragraphs of an HTML document, or specific parts, such as required fields, of a complicated form. PlaceMarkers can be defined as temporary or permanent and can be anchored to text, elements of the current web page, or to a website's domain. Multiple PlaceMarkers can be added to HTML or PDF documents, while only one can be added to a Word document.

The following describes how to add, rename, or delete PlaceMarkers. If you are not familiar with PlaceMarkers and need more information, refer to Important PlaceMarker Concepts. For additional PlaceMarker operation, refer to Advanced PlaceMarker Usage. For general information about using PlaceMarkers in a Word document, refer to Marking and Returning to a PlaceMarker in Word.

Adding a Temporary PlaceMarker

To quickly add a temporary PlaceMarker, do the following:

1.    Open a web page, other HTML document, or PDF document.

2.    Move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put the PlaceMarker.

3.    Press CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K. A temporary PlaceMarker now appears on the page.
 
 You can always jump to it using any of the following Navigation Quick Keys: K, SHIFT+K, SHIFT+ number row keys 7 through 0, or CTRL+SHIFT+K. (The last keystroke opens the PlaceMarker List. Select Temporary from the list, and then choose the Move To button.)

In Internet Explorer and Chrome, a temporary PlaceMarker can also be set in document edit fields, such as those found in web-based editors like Google Docs to enable selecting blocks of text in documents.

Selecting Between the Temporary PlaceMarker and the Cursor Position

To select text between a temporary PlaceMarker and your current position in a web page, HTML document, or document edit field, do the following:

1.    Press CTRL+WINDOWS Key+k to set a temporary PlaceMarker.

2.    Navigate to another location on the web page or document text, then press INSERT+SPACEBAR, M. All text between the temporary PlaceMarker and your current cursor position is selected and ready to be copied to the Clipboard.

This method is often easier than using the SHIFT Key in conjunction with the ARROW keys when attempting to select large blocks of text.

Note: Due to current limitations with Chrome, text selection in an edit field only works reliably when performed in the same paragraph.

Adding Permanent PlaceMarkers to Web Pages or HTML Documents

To add a PlaceMarker, do the following:

1.    Open a web page or other HTML document.

2.    Move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put the PlaceMarker.

3.    Press CTRL+SHIFT+K and then ENTER.
 The Add PlaceMarker dialog box opens with focus in the Name edit field. It contains text that appears at the cursor location. If you want to change the PlaceMarker name, type a new name in this field; otherwise, press TAB to move to the next control.

4.    The Define for All Pages on Current Domain check box is cleared by default, which allows the PlaceMarker to be anchored only to the current web page or HTML document. If you want to use this PlaceMarker so that it is anchored to all pages within the current domain instead, press SPACEBAR to select the check box. Press TAB to move to the next control.

5.    The Anchor to Text check box is cleared by default. Select this check box if you want to link the PlaceMarker with specific text, such as a heading, that appears on the page. This can be useful on frequently updated web pages where text and elements tend to drift from their original position. When selected, the next control, Anchor Text edit field, automatically populates using the original text in the Name edit field. This guarantees that the PlaceMarker will always be associated with this text on the web page.

6.    Press TAB to navigate to the OK button and press SPACEBAR to close the dialog box and save the PlaceMarker.

Renaming PlaceMarkers

To change the name of a PlaceMarker, do the following:

1.    Open the page containing the PlaceMarker you want to rename.

2.    Press CTRL+SHIFT+K to display a list of PlaceMarkers on this page.

3.    Use the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW keys to select the PlaceMarker.

4.    Press SPACEBAR on the Change Name button or press ALT+C.

Tip: If you want to delete all PlaceMarkers for this page, press SPACEBAR on the Remove All button or press ALT+L.

Important PlaceMarker Concepts

The following sections, PlaceMarker Keystrokes, Temporary versus Permanent PlaceMarkers, and URL versus Domain PlaceMarkers, are key to understanding PlaceMarkers with JAWS.

PlaceMarker Keystrokes for Web Pages, HTML Documents, or Forms

·         Press CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K to insert a temporary PlaceMarker.

·         Press INSERT+SPACEBAR, M to select text between the temporary PlaceMarker and your current cursor position.

·         Press CTRL+SHIFT+K to open the PlaceMarker List dialog box to add a new PlaceMarker, rename or change existing PlaceMarker parameters, jump to PlaceMarkers, or delete PlaceMarkers.  

·         Press K to jump to the next PlaceMarker.

·         Press SHIFT+K to jump to the previous PlaceMarker.

·         Press number row keys 7 through 0 to hear the content of PlaceMarkers 1 through 4.

·         Press SHIFT+ number row keys 7 through 0 to jump to PlaceMarkers 1 through 4.

·         Press ALT+WINDOWS Key+K to speak all of the PlaceMarkers on a Web page or in an HTML document.

Temporary Versus Permanent PlaceMarkers

You can add a temporary PlaceMarker anywhere on a web page by pressing CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K. This lets you easily mark a spot that you can return to later by pressing K. Only one temporary PlaceMarker may be set per web page. If you later decide to move the temporary PlaceMarker to a different place on the web page, just move the Virtual Cursor to that new location and press CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K again.

If you want to make the temporary PlaceMarker permanent, press CTRL+SHIFT+K to open the PlaceMarker List dialog box and add it to the list, which lets you keep and maintain multiple PlaceMarkers on the web page, HTML document, or form. The last location where you set a temporary PlaceMarker is saved until you move it again, or remove the PlaceMarker from the PlaceMarkers List dialog. You can browse to other web pages, exit JAWS, even restart your computer, and your temporary and permanent PlaceMarkers are preserved.

URL Versus Domain PlaceMarkers

JAWS lets you assign PlaceMarkers to either the current web address (the URL displayed in the Address bar) or domain (the overall website name). The URL (uniform resource locator) is the web address displayed in the address bar. You can only use PlaceMarkers assigned to the current URL when you are visiting that page.

Individual web pages are contained within a domain. The domain's name is usually the first portion of the page's web address and ends with .com, .net, .org, .gov, .edu, or similar suffix. When you add a domain PlaceMarker to a web page, you can use that PlaceMarker on any page within the current domain. Since many sites use a consistent design for all of their pages, the placement of links, graphics, buttons, and form fields is often similar. If this is the case, you can use a single domain PlaceMarker to navigate many other pages on the site.

For example, if a website has a Search box located at the top of each page, you can put a domain PlaceMarker there named "Search." You can then use this PlaceMarker to move to the Search box on any page in the domain, regardless of the URL.

Advanced PlaceMarker Usage

The following describes other ways to customize and display PlaceMarkers.

Custom Page Summary

When you open an HTML page, the Custom Page Summary feature automatically lists each PlaceMarker on the page and its associated text. This lets you quickly review the text located near your PlaceMarkers so you can hear any changes or updates to those areas of the page. To enable or disable this feature, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center (INSERT+F2) or Quick Settings (INSERT+V).

2.    In the Search edit box, type "PlaceMarker" without the quotes.

3.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to Custom PlaceMarker Page Summary in the filtered results of the tree view. (Note that for web browsers, this option appears in both the Virtual Cursor Options group and the Personalized Web Settings group.)

4.    Press SPACEBAR to toggle through the following settings.

·         Select "Speak PlaceMarkers on Page Load" to have JAWS read the name of each PlaceMarker on the current page as well as the text that appears near the PlaceMarker's location.

·         Select "List PlaceMarkers in Results Viewer on Page Load" to have JAWS display the PlaceMarker information for the page in the Results Viewer. The Results Viewer provides a link with the name of the PlaceMarker and the text that appears near the PlaceMarker's location on the page. You can use the ARROW keys to move to a link and then press ENTER to move to that PlaceMarker.

·         Select "Do Nothing" to have JAWS provide a custom page summary.

Custom Labels

JAWS allows you to assign custom text labels to almost any HTML element that you can move to by pressing the TAB key in Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox. These elements include text links, graphic links, form fields, and buttons. You can also label images on Web pages. JAWS reads these custom labels instead of the identifying text assigned to the elements by the Web page author. JAWS also uses custom labels to identify elements when they appear in lists, such as the list of form fields that displays when you press INSERT+F5. You can use this feature to customize the elements of any Web page to help you navigate the page, reduce verbosity, compensate for incomplete or poorly labeled elements, and similar functions.

Tip: You can also use this feature to label form fields in Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

JAWS saves the labels you assign to a Web page so they are available each time you use that page. In addition, the labels you create are applied to identical elements any time they appear in that page's domain. For example, if you assign a label to a button, JAWS reads that label any time you encounter the button on any Web page within that domain. Custom labels are saved in .jsi files in the Settings\Enu\PersonalizedSettings folder.

Assigning a Custom Label

To assign a custom label to an element or change a custom label already assigned to an element, do the following:

1.    Move to the element you want to label. You can use the TAB key, standard JAWS reading commands, or a list of elements.

2.    Press INSERT+F2, select "Custom Label," and press ENTER.

Tip: You can also press CTRL+INSERT+TAB to create a custom label for the current element.

3.    Type the text you want to use for the label and press ENTER.

JAWS reads the new custom label each time you encounter this element. In addition, JAWS displays the custom label instead of the original identifying text when the element appears in JAWS lists. However, if you use INSERT+Z to turn off the virtual cursor, your custom labels will not be available.

Deleting a Custom Label

To delete a custom label, do the following:

1.    Move to the element with the label you want to delete. You can use the TAB key, standard JAWS reading commands, or a list of elements.

2.    Press INSERT+F2, select "Custom Label Delete," and press ENTER.

To delete all custom labels on a page, do the following:

1.    Go to the Web page containing the labels you want to delete.

2.    Press INSERT+F2, select "Custom Label Delete All," and press ENTER.

HTML Options

In HTML documents, JAWS provides a high level of flexibility so you may work in the way you find most comfortable. The Quick Settings tree view (INSERT+V) allows you to conveniently change settings which control what types of information and how much of it JAWS provides. HTML settings are saved across sessions once you set them. To change your current settings while using Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Edge, press INSERT+V.

Tip: JAWS also allows you to apply the settings described below only to specific websites. This allows you to customize how certain sites interact with JAWS. For more information on this feature, refer to Personalized Web Settings.

Internet Explorer Options Group

The following describes the items in the Internet Explorer Settings group. These options are only available if Quick Settings is opened from Internet Explorer.

Information Bar

This option controls how JAWS handles the Information bar. Select Ignore for JAWS to ignore changes. Select Announce Change and JAWS will announce changes to the Information Bar in the Message voice. Virtualize means that JAWS will show the Information Bar in a mini virtual document. The default setting is Announce Change.

RSS Feeds

This option controls how JAWS will handle the RSS Feeds. Select Ignore for JAWS to ignore changes. Select Announce Change and JAWS will announce changes to the RSS Feeds in the Message voice. Virtualize means that JAWS will show the RSS Feeds in a mini virtual document. The default setting is Announce Change.

Frame Update Notification

This option controls how JAWS notifies you that a frame has been updated. Off sends no notification. Speak Frame Name speaks the name of the frame which was last updated. Move To Frame moves the cursor to the beginning of the most recently updated frame and speaks the line. The default setting is Speak Frame Name.

Virtual Cursor Options Group

The following describes the items in the Virtual Cursor Options group. This also includes the following subgroups: Form Options, General Options, Text Options, Graphics Options, Link Options, Heading and Frame Options, and Table Options.

Virtual Cursor Verbosity Level

Use this option to select a Virtual Cursor verbosity level. The verbosity level determines the amount of information spoken by JAWS when the Virtual Cursor is active. The available options are:

·         High - JAWS speaks the most information about elements on the page or inside a document. Everything except the start and end of application and document regions is announced at this level.

·         Medium - This level is configured to provide the best user experience on most pages and documents and is the default verbosity level. By default, JAWS will not indicate the start and end for flash objects or frames, and only the start and end of navigation and main regions is announced. Note that the name and type for all regions is still announced when using the R and SHIFT+R Navigation Quick Keys to move by region or the O and SHIFT+O Navigation Quick Keys to move by article.

·         Low - JAWS speaks as little structural information as possible about the elements on a page or inside a document. By default, only the start and end of tables and grids is announced at this level.

To customize a verbosity level, open Settings Center, expand the Web/HTML/PDFs group, expand the Reading group, and expand the Configure Web Verbosity Levels group. Next, press the SPACEBAR on the verbosity level you want to customize. A dialog box opens containing a tree view listing the structural elements that can be announced by the Virtual Cursor. Use the SPACEBAR to select or clear an element and then choose OK to save your changes.

Allow Web Application Reserved Keystrokes

Certain interactive Web sites may offer keyboard shortcuts to perform some common tasks. For example, on the Facebook Web site you can press P to post a status, L to like a story, C to comment on a story, or J and K to scroll between News Feed stories. However, these keystrokes also conflict with JAWS Navigation Quick Keys. When this check box is selected, any JAWS keystrokes that are also defined as keystrokes by a Web site will perform the site specific task instead of the JAWS command. For this to work correctly, the page must also include a line of code that tells JAWS what keystrokes are defined by the web site. If this information is not available, all JAWS commands will continue to work as expected. This check box is selected by default.

Select and Copy

This option controls whether or not JAWS will use the Text Selection and Copy Commands from the Web browser, e-mail software, or other owner of a virtual document.

With the From Virtual Cursor setting, text is copied as plain text without formatting, pictures, and HTML attributes.

With the Full Content Using Onscreen Highlight setting, the text and elements you select are highlighted onscreen as you press selection keys from the keyboard just as it would in programs like word processors. When you press CTRL+C to copy, the content is then copied with all formatting as provided by the application as if it was selected with the Mouse. This is the default setting.

Read Only State

This option controls whether to announce or ignore read-only state information in form fields. The default setting is Announce.

Forms Options Subgroup

Auto Forms Mode

This option determines if JAWS uses the Auto Forms Mode feature in applications where the Virtual Cursor is used. The following options are available:

·         Auto – JAWS automatically switches to Forms Mode when you press TAB or ARROW Keys to move into an edit field or combo box. When you exit the control, Forms Mode turns off. Parameters that control this convenient feature are described in the following options in this section. This is the default setting.

·         Semi-autoJAWS automatically switches to Forms Mode when you move into an edit field or combo box using the TAB or SHIFT+TAB keys. This allows you to navigate through the Web page using the ARROW keys without being interupted by the change to Forms Mode if you encounter a field.

·         Manual – You must press ENTER to turn Forms Mode on when typing text into an edit field or interacting with a combo box. To turn off Forms Mode after exiting an edit field, press NUM PAD PLUS or ESC.

Use Sounds

As you move into and out of a form field, JAWS can use sounds to indicate when it switches between Virtual Mode and Forms Mode instead of speaking the traditional messages, Forms Mode On and Forms Mode Off. Turn this option off if you do not want to hear sounds and would prefer to hear the traditional spoken messages. This setting is on by default.

Note: This option is available when the Auto Forms Mode option is on or off.

Navigation Quick Key Delay

When using Navigation Quick Keys to move about a form, this option determines how long it takes before Forms Mode becomes active after moving to an edit field or combo box. Settings for this option range from 0.5 seconds to 5 seconds and Never. Never is the default setting. This means that when using Navigation Quick Keys, JAWS will not automatically enter Forms Mode. However, if you set it to another choice, such as 3 seconds, and then use Navigation Quick Keys to move to an edit control, Forms Mode activates following a 3-second delay. This option is unavailable if Auto Forms Mode is set to Manual or Semi-auto.

Note: JAWS can be configured to emit a sound when you enter or exit a form field. The sound is heard when Forms Mode becomes active.

Buttons Show Using

This option lets you select how JAWS announces the attributes of graphical buttons on forms. The following settings are available:

·         Screen Text – JAWS reads the same text that appears on the screen for the button image. This is the default setting.

·         Title – JAWS reads the title text if alt text is not available for the image. The title attribute provides supplemental information about an image.

·         Alt Attribute – JAWS reads the alt text, a brief description included with an image, for the button.

·         Value – JAWS reads the state of the image, for example, if it is pressed or not pressed.

·         Longest – JAWS reads the long description attribute associated with an image button.

Form Fields Identify Prompt Using

This option controls which method JAWS uses to identify prompts or labels for form fields. Available settings are Label Tag, Title Attribute, Alt Attribute, Longest, and Both Label and Title.
 For the Both Label and Title option, JAWS only uses both if they are different.
 The default setting is to use the label tag.

Forms Mode Off When New Page Loads

This option controls whether or not JAWS automatically turns off Forms Mode when a new page loads, or when you switch to a new tab or window. When this option is on, you can have Forms Mode on in a search window, while viewing results in another window, or when pressing TAB to navigate an HTML document. This setting is on by default.

Note: This option is unavailable if Auto Forms Mode is on.

General Options Subgroup

Smart Navigation Mode

Smart Navigation offers a more efficient way to navigate in web-based applications, tables, and forms. The following options are available:

·         Controls: Controls, including, but not limited to, buttons, links, edit fields, list boxes, tree views, and headings, are treated as single units when navigating by character or word, like moving through a menu bar with RIGHT and LEFT ARROW. Performing a Say Character, Say Word, and Say Line command while focused on a control will temporarily disable Smart Navigation so you can use the traditional navigation by character, word, line, sentence, and paragraph to review a control, such as the text of a button or link, in greater detail. Smart Navigation automatically resumes when you press ESC, or move to another control using TAB or UP or DOWN ARROW. If you encounter a table, you will still use the table reading commands (CTRL+ALT+ARROW keys) or the Table layer (INSERT+SPACEBAR, t) to navigate the table.

·         Controls and Tables: If focused inside of a table, the RIGHT and LEFT ARROW keys move between columns while the UP and DOWN ARROW keys move between rows. When focused in a cell and it contains any controls, such as a heading, or an edit field, pressing the Say Character, Say Word, or Say Line commands twice quickly will switch to control navigation, and performing these commands again twice quickly will switch to character and word navigation. If the cell does not contain controls, you can only switch to character and word navigation. Pressing ESC or moving focus away from the control or table cell will switch back to the prior navigation level, for example, pressing ESC while in character and word navigation will return to Smart Navigation in tables. If you are not in a table, navigation is the same as the Controls option.

·         Off: Navigating by character or word in virtual documents works as it always has in JAWS. This is the default setting.

Anytime you are using Smart Navigation, either set to Controls or Controls and Tables, JAWS will work in Screen Layout. This presents pages in the virtual buffer similar to how they appear visually on the screen. Toolbar buttons or other lists of controls that are visually laid out horizontally on the screen are displayed on one line in the virtual document, allowing a single press of the DOWN ARROW to skip the entire toolbar instead of having to move from button to button to get past it.

Document and Web Pages Automatically Read When Loaded

When this option is turned on, JAWS automatically begins reading web pages and PDF documents when loaded. Turn off this option if you do not want JAWS to automatically begin reading. Disabling this option is especially useful if you are using JAWS in conjunction with screen magnification software as the focus is not unexpectedly moved back to the top while you are using the mouse to navigate through the document. The default setting for this option is on when only JAWS is running and is off by default when using Fusion or FSReader.

Navigation Quick Keys

Navigation Quick Keys make it faster and easier to move around on a web page, and anywhere else the Virtual Cursor is active. These commands are all assigned to keys on the main part of the keyboard, and are easy to remember and use. Set the Navigation Quick Keys to be on whenever the Virtual Cursor is active; set them to be on only when Say All is used; or turn them off. The default setting is on.

Document Presentation

This option allows you to change how JAWS structures HTML pages and other virtual documents (such as PDF documents) in the virtual buffer. If you select "Simple Layout," each cell in the table is displayed on a separate line. This is the default layout. If you select "Screen Layout," pages are rendered in the virtual buffer in a way that is more similar to what a sighted user sees on the screen. All items in a single table row are displayed on the same line, and each column is separated by a vertical bar. The default setting is Simple Layout.

Custom Placemarker Page Summary

When you open an HTML page, the Placemarker Page Summary feature automatically lists each PlaceMarker on the page and its associated text. Select Speak PlaceMarkers on Page Load to hear the name of each PlaceMarker and its associated text. Select List PlaceMarkers in Results Viewer on Page Load to have PlaceMarker information for the page appear in the Results Viewer. Select Do Nothing if you do not want to hear the PlaceMarker summary. The default setting is Do Nothing.

For more information, refer to PlaceMarkers.

Access Keys Indicate

This option controls whether or not JAWS shows access keys coded into web pages in the virtual cursor. These keys are designed by web page authors so you can quickly move to certain sections or activate certain controls on web pages. This setting is on by default.

Attributes Indicate

This option controls whether or not JAWS indicates attributes, such as clickable and onMouseover. With speech, JAWS indicates these by saying "Clickable" or "onMouseover" respectively. You can change what is said, or what sound to use in the Speech and Sounds Manager. In braille, you see clk and omo respectively, after the text of the element or item. To activate the onMouseOver attribute, press CTRL+INSERT+ENTER. To activate Clickable, tap with a cursor routing button or press ENTER or the left mouse button on the item. This setting is on by default.

Flash Movies Recognize

Set this option to off to ignore Flash content on web pages. This setting is on by default.

Page Refresh

This option allows you to specify the frequency with which pages reload. By default, pages refresh automatically based on settings in the HTML code. You can also choose to have pages refresh every 60 seconds, or choose Off to suppress all refreshes of web pages.

Announce Live Region Updates

The dynamic section of a web page that receives constant updates, such as news headlines, business information, and weather updates, is known as a live region. JAWS automatically announces updates for web pages containing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Live Region markup tags. Web content creators add ARIA tags to their pages to mark regions as "live." Select On, which is the default, if you want JAWS to announce new information when a live region refreshes. Select Off if you do not want to hear updates.

Screen Track Virtual Cursor

This option controls whether or not JAWS causes the screen to track the Virtual Cursor. When JAWS does this, sighted users can more easily tell where you are on the Web page. Since Web pages do not have a cursor, like Microsoft Word does, this tracking feature works to keep the content you are viewing on screen. The default setting is on.

Link Activation

This option affects how links are activated when you press the ENTER key in a virtual document.

When this option is set to "Enter simulates mouse click," pressing the ENTER key on a link actually simulates a left mouse click on the link. This is how JAWS behaved prior to JAWS 15.

When this option is set to "Enter sends Enter key," pressing the ENTER key on a link instead causes the ENTER key to be passed on to the system. You may want to consider setting this option to "Enter sends Enter key" if pressing ENTER does not activate a Web element unless you first press INSERT+3 to enable the Pass Key Through feature.

The default setting is "Enter simulates mouse click."

Text Options Subgroup

Abbreviations Expand

This option controls how JAWS shows abbreviations in the Virtual Cursor. If on, JAWS will use the title attribute, if provided by the web page author, for the given abbreviation. If off, JAWS will display the abbreviation as it is on screen. The default setting is off.

Acronyms Expand

This option controls how JAWS shows acronyms in the Virtual Cursor. If on, JAWS uses the title attribute, if provided by the Web page author, for the given acronym. If off, JAWS displays the acronym as it is on screen. The default setting is off.

Repeated Text Skip

This option controls whether or not JAWS skips repeated (or common) text at the top of new links when you click them on Web pages. This text is usually the same for a given Web site, such as navigation information found at the top of the page.

When this option is on, JAWS places the virtual cursor below the "repeated" or common text. This is the default setting.

Graphics Subgroup

Graphics Show

Graphics are sometimes used to enhance the appearance of a web page. This option controls the amount of information JAWS provides about graphics.

·         Tagged: JAWS says "graphic" and then reads alternative text accompanying graphics, if available, and ignores graphics with no alternative text. This is the default setting.

·         All: JAWS says "graphic" when a graphic is encountered and reads the alternate text, if available, or reads the image file name if alternate text is not specified.

·         None: JAWS provides no information about graphics.

For more information, refer to Graphics and Links.

Graphics Recognized by

This option allows you to specify the type of information JAWS provides about HTML graphics.

·         Title: JAWS first looks for and speaks information provided by the HTML Title attribute. If no Title attribute is found, JAWS looks for Alt attribute information and speaks it.

·         Alt attribute: JAWS first looks for and speaks information provided by the HTML Alt attribute. If no Alt attribute is found, JAWS looks for Title attribute information and speaks it. This is the default setting.

·         On Mouseover: JAWS looks for "OnMouseOver quoted text," Alt text, then Title text. JAWS speaks the first information found.

·         Longest: The longest string of information is spoken for each graphic.

·         Custom Search: JAWS searches for information in the order specified in Settings Center, HTML Options and reads the first information found.

Links Subgroup

Filter Duplicate Links

This option controls if JAWS only announces the text link when two consecutive Web page links, typically a graphical link and text link, point to the same URL. It is selected by default. When selected, JAWS will only announce the text link when you navigate the Web page using ARROW Keys.

Graphical Links Show

This option allows you to select whether JAWS announces all graphical links, only tagged graphical links, or none. The default setting is All. For more information, refer to Graphics and Links.

Untagged Graphical Links Show

This option controls how JAWS shows graphical links without tags. Available settings are URL and Image Source.

The URL points to the page you will be on if you click the link. The image source points to the name of the file used as the graphic or image. The default setting is Image Source.

Links In Image Map Show

This option controls which links in image maps JAWS shows. Available settings are None, Tagged, and All. The default setting is All.

Text Links Show Using

This option controls what information JAWS uses to show text links in the Virtual Cursor. These links do not have graphical content, but are embedded in the text of the content of the web page or document. Available settings are Screen Text, On Mouse Over, Title, Longest, and Custom Search. The default setting is Screen Text.

Links Identify Type

This option controls whether or not JAWS identifies the link type as it reads and displays the Web page on the braille display. When this option is off, JAWS still identifies links, it just does not identify links as mail, ftp, or other link types. It still identifies links as image map, graphic or graphic link. This setting is on by default.

Links Identify "Same Page"

This option controls whether or not JAWS identifies the "same page" status of links pointing to another place on the same Web page or document. When this option is off, JAWS still identifies links in speech and braille, but does not announce "same page" as part of the link identification. This setting is on by default.

Heading and Frame Options Subgroup

Headings Announce

This option controls how JAWS announces headings in virtual documents. Select between Off, On, and Heading and Level. The default setting is Heading and Level.

Inline Frames Show

This option controls whether or not the contents of inline frames are shown in the Virtual Cursor. Inline frames are often those which contain banner ads, but can be used by Web page authors to present information. You may want to turn this off if a particular Web page has a lot of frame start and end markings with useless or no content in between. Settings for this option determine whether the whole content, including start and end marks if appropriate, is shown or not. This setting is on by default.

Table Options Subgroup

Layout Tables Ignore

This option controls whether or not JAWS recognizes tables used exclusively for formatting purposes. Such tables are often used as navigation bars at the top, bottom, or side of the Web page. You will still see the buttons within the navigation bar and they will still be shown one after the other in the Virtual Cursor, but you will not see the table start and end marks. This setting is on by default.

Table Titles

This option controls which table header titles are to be announced when a table cell is spoken as you navigate using Table commands within tables. As you navigate, only the relevant title is read. For example, as you move by row, only the row header is announced as it changes. The same is true when navigating by column. Select "Off" to have no titles announced.

You can select row, column, both row and column, or only marked headers. If you choose only marked headers, only the explicitly marked headers will be spoken for the row or column title. If you choose row, column or both headers, JAWS will first look for the explicitly marked headers for the row or column title. If marked headers are not found, JAWS will guess which row or column to use for the title. As you navigate, only the changed title matching your title announcement choice is spoken. If you use the ALT+CTRL+NUM PAD 5 keystroke to read the current cell, all titles matching your announcement choice are spoken. The default setting is Only Marked Headers.

Cell Coordinates Announcement

This option controls whether or not cell coordinates are announced when table navigation is used. When selected, table cell coordinates are announced after the cell content. This setting is on by default.

Personalized Web Settings

Personalized Web settings allow you to make changes to JAWS that affect only a specific Web site. JAWS remembers these settings and loads them each time you visit the Web site again.

Personalized Web settings apply to any page under the domain or subdomain where you make the changes. For example, if you opened the page www.freedomscientific.com/training.asp and personalized the page, changes would apply to any page under www.freedomscientific.com. However, if you made changes somewhere on shopping.yahoo.com, those settings would not apply to a page such as mail.yahoo.com because the subdomain is different. JAWS informs you when you visit a domain that has personalized settings.

You can personalize many types of Web settings. For example:

·         Prevent Web sites from automatically refreshing, so the information does not reload and cause JAWS to read from the top of the page all over again.

·         Turn off graphic links on sites where alternate text is not provided or where the graphic links do not provide useful information.

·         Turn off heading announcement when headings are not used to structure information on a page.

·         Turn off navigation quick keys on pages that use certain types of access keys so the keys do not conflict.

·         Personalize Web settings for forms, frames, lists, and long quotations.

Personalizing Web Settings

Do the following to create or modify personalized settings for a Web page. Note that changes made are saved permanently to JSI files (for example, FreedomScientific.com.jsi) and do not apply to other Web pages. JSI files are stored in the PersonalizedSettings folder, which can be found by choosing the Start button, All Programs, JAWS X (where X is the JAWS version number), Explore JAWS, and then the Explore My Settings folder.

1.    Press INSERT+V to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.

2.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to the Quick Settings tree view.

3.    Press P to move to the Personalize Web Settings group. If necessary, press RIGHT ARROW to expand the group.

4.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to the different options and groups within Personalize Web Settings, and press SPACEBAR to make changes.

5.    After making all necessary changes, press TAB to move to the OK button and then press SPACEBAR to save changes and exit Quick Settings.

Flexible Web

Frequently, you will encounter web pages that contain a lot of excess content which can make it difficult to locate the actual content you want, or interupts the flow when reading. For instance, many sites contain Google ad frames. These can be troublesome for JAWS users as they disrupt the reading order of surrounding content.

Flexible Web enables you to take more control of web pages by allowing you to quickly find the content you are looking for, as well as hide content that interrupts the reading experience. You can hide sections of content, such as Google ad frames or other types of unnecessary content, for a smoother reading experience. In addition, you could have JAWS begin reading at a level one heading, or ARIA main region, as these may contain the most interesting content.

To use Flexible Web, open a web page you want to customize in Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Firefox. Then, move the Virtual PC Cursor to the page element you want to hide, or from where you want to start reading when the page first loads. Activate the Flexible Web wizard by pressing the layered keystroke INSERT+SPACEBAR, X. Alternatively, press INSERT+F2 to open the Run JAWS Manager dialog box, then choose Flexible Web.

Through several easy-to-follow steps, The Flexible Web wizard that opens provides you with two options: hide, or start reading at the selected element. The wizard then guides you through the process of creating a temporary customization by giving you various choices about the selected element and how you want to hide it or from where exactly to start reading. Once the customization has been made, it is immediately applied to the page. For instance, if you choose to hide all frames containing advertisements, you will not see any advertisements when navigating the page after making this temporary customization.

If you are not happy with how a customization is working, you can open the Flexible Web wizard to undo the last customization you made. When you return to the page, you can choose a different element or the same one, then reactivate the Flexible Web wizard to retry the customization again perhaps with different criteria. For example, in the case of hiding those advertisement frames mentioned earlier, you probably want to hide all of them, not just the first one on the page. The wizard will provide you with choices about whether to hide just the first one or all of them.

You can create as many customizations for a page as you want. Once you have created one or more customizations, you can save them as a rule, which is applied every time you load the particular page or site. To indicate that a rule has been applied to a page, JAWS plays a sound after the page loads. Rules can be applied to the current web page, entire website, or globally for all websites. Otherwise, customizations are only temporary and are lost as soon as you navigate away from the current web page or close the browser. If you have made temporary customizations and you attempt to navigate to another page or close the browser, a dialog box opens asking if you want to save your customizations as a rule.

Creating Customizations and Rules

Following is an example of a situation where you might use Flexible Web to improve the reading experience on a Web page.

You frequently visit a news Web site where you would like to have JAWS start reading at the beginning of the article, which is the first level one heading on the page. Between the heading and the beginning of the text is an annoying frame called Social containing links to various social Web sites that you do not want to hear or read. You would first create two temporary customizations that start reading at the first level 1 heading and hide all frames named Social. You would then save these as a rule which will be applied each time you load a page from this Web site.

Creating Temporary Customizations

To customize this site so JAWS starts reading at the first level one heading and ignores the Social frame, do the following:

1.    Move the Virtual PC Cursor to the first level one heading which contains the title of the article and press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard. By default, the Create new customization radio button is selected.

2.    Choose Next and you are prompted with the type of customization you want to create. Select Start reading at an element, then choose Next.

3.    You are now asked what element you want to customize. The first item in the list is the level one heading containing the article title. Since this is the element where you want JAWS to start reading, choose Next.

4.    In the list box, select a customization. In this case, select the option Start reading at heading 1, 1 from the top. This is because you want this customization to work for every article on the site, not just the current one.

5.    Choose Finish and you are returned to the page.

6.    Move the Virtual PC Cursor to the frame called Social and press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard again. Since a customization has already been created, there are now several radio buttons that have become available, including Retry, Undo, and Save temporary customizations as a rule. However, the default radio button is still Create a new customization, so choose Next.

7.    Select Hide an element, then choose Next.

8.    From the list of elements you can customize, choose the Social frame, then choose Next.

9.    In the list of possible choices for how to hide the selected element, select Hide all frames named Social. This hides all frames with the name Social no matter where they appear on the page.

10. Choose Finish to return to the page. As you navigate the page, the virtual buffer will no longer show the Social frame between the title of the article and its text.

Note: Customizations only apply for the current browser window or tab. This allows you to have the same page open in two browser windows at the same time so you can try customizations on one page, while leaving the other one unchanged.

Retrying a Customization

If you are not completely satisfied with how a customization is working, you can undo the customization and try creating it again. For instance, you may have created the customization using the wrong element.

To retry a customization, do the following:

1.    Move the Virtual PC cursor to the element on the page you want to customize and press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard.

2.    Select the Retry radio button and choose Next.

3.    The most recent customization you made is deleted. Follow the steps in the wizard to create a new customization.

If you want to delete the last customization you made without creating a new one, press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard and choose the Undo radio button. Select Finish to remove the customization and return to the Web page.

Saving One or More Temporary Customizations as a Rule

Currently,the customizations you made in this example are temporary. To save them as a permenant rule, do the following:

1.    Press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard. Select the Save temporary customizations as a rule radio button, then choose Next.

2.    In the Rule name edit field, enter a name for the rule, for example, "News Article Web Site".

3.    Press TAB to move to the checkable list of customizations that will be included in the rule. By default, all customizations are selected. You can exclude a customization from the rule by pressing the SPACEBAR to clear its check mark.

4.    Press TAB to move to the How would you like this rule to apply combo box. The available choices are Globally, To the current site, or To the current page. The default option is To the current site. If you want to apply the rule to the current page (such as the home page of a site), or globally, so it applies to all sites, move up or down through the combo box to select the option you want. In our example, we will choose the default so that the rule is applied to any page within the current site.

5.    Choose Finish to create the new rule.

Now, when ever you visit any page on this site, JAWS will begin reading at the first level 1 heading and all frames named Social will not appear in the virtual view.

Rules are browser specific. This means that if you save rules for a page in Internet Explorer then access the same page in Firefox, the rules you created will not work. You will need to create the rule again in Firefox.

Managing Rules

You can manage rules by opening the Flexible Web wizard and choosing View and change where rules apply. In the dialog box that opens, you can rename, delete, enable,disable, or move existing rules from one page or site to another without having to re-create the entire rule.

The Flexible Web viewer dialog box contains a tree view and a checkable list view. The tree view lists the sites and pages for which you have saved Flexible Web rules. The top level is Global, level one is Current site, and level two is Current page. The list view shows all rules. Every rule has a check mark next to it. If a rule is supposed to be executed for a current location in the tree view, the rule is checked, otherwise it is unchecked.

For example, let’s say that you have created three different rules: "Rule A" to be applied globally for all sites, “Rule B” for google.com, and “Rule C” for a specific page on cnn.com. If Global is selected in the tree, you will find that only “Rule A” will be checked in the list of rules, which means that no matter how many saved rules there are, only “Rule A” will run on every single page.

If the currently selected item in the tree is google.com, then both “Rule A” and “Rule B” will be checked. “Rule A” is checked for google.com because it is supposed to run on all sites and “Rule B” is checked, because it was saved specifically for google.com. “Rule C” is not checked because it was saved for one of the pages on cnn.com and therefore does not apply to google.com.

From the list of rules, you can enable or disable rules as well as delete, rename, or view properties of the selected rule.

Enabling or Disabling a Rule

To enable or disable a rule for a site or page, do the following:

1.    From the browser where you have created Flexible Web rules, press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard.

2.    Choose the View and change where rules apply radio button.

3.    Move to the Finish button and press ENTER. This closes the wizard and opens a viewer that contains a treeview. Its root is Global, its level 1 branch is Current site, and its level 2 branch is Current page. The default location when the Viewer opens is Global.

4.    Navigate the tree, opening the Current Site or Current page branch as desired. Each branch will include the name of the site or page of a site.

5.    From the desired site or page whose rules you want to examine, press TAB to move to the next control. This is a checkable list view of rules. If the currently selected rule is being applied to the current page or site, it will be checked. Otherwise, any rules that appear in the list will be unchecked.

6.    If the rule is currently checked – that is, it is applied to the current page, site, or globally, and you just want to disable it without deleting it, then uncheck the rule by pressing SPACEBAR. Otherwise, if the rule is unchecked – that is, it is not applied to the current page or site, but you do wish to apply it, then check it by pressing SPACEBAR.

7.    When you are finished, press TAB to move to the Close button and press ENTER.

Deleting a Rule

To delete a rule, do the following:

1.    From the browser where you have created Flexible Web rules, press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard.

2.    Choose the View and change where rules apply radio button and press ENTER.

3.    When the Flexible Web viewer opens, press TAB to move to the list of rules.

4.    Navigate to the rule you want to delete and press the DELETE Key. Alternatively, press the APPLICATIONS Key to open the context menu and choose Delete. When asked if you want to continue, choose Yes to delete the rule, or No to cancel the deletion.

Caution: If you choose Yes, the rule will be deleted and you will have to recreate it in order to use it again. This also means that if there were multiple sites or pages that were using this rule, they will no longer run it as well. If you need to temporarily stop a rule from being applied for a specific page or site, simply clear its check mark instead of deleting it. You can then select it again when you need it.

5.    When you are finished, press TAB to move to the Close button and press ENTER.

Renaming a Rule

To rename a rule, do the following:

1.    From the browser where you have created Flexible Web rules, press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard.

2.    Choose the View and change where rules apply radio button and press ENTER.

3.    When the Flexible Web viewer opens, press TAB to move to the list of rules.

4.    Navigate to the rule you want to rename and press F2 to rename the rule. Alternatively, you can press the APPLICATIONS Key to open the context menu and choose Rename. This opens a dialog box where you can edit the name of the rule similar to renaming a file in Windows Explorer.

5.    Edit the rule name then press ENTER to confirm the change or ESC to cancel.

6.    When you are finished, press TAB to move to the Close button and press ENTER.

Viewing the Customizations in a Rule

To view the list of customizations that are included in a rule, do the following:

1.    From the browser where you have created Flexible Web rules, press INSERT+SPACEBAR, X to open the Flexible Web wizard.

2.    Choose the View and change where rules apply radio button and press ENTER.

3.    When the Flexible Web viewer opens, press TAB to move to the list of rules.

4.    Navigate to the rule you want to view, then press the APPLICATIONS Key to open the context menu and choose Properties.

5.    When the Properties dialog box opens, you are on a read-only control that shows the name of the current rule whose settings you wish to examine. For example, you may have set several temporary customizations as a single rule. Therefore, the properties for the rule will include the various customizations made for that rule. Press TAB to move to the properties list and use the ARROW keys to navigate the list of properties associated with the rule.

6.    When you are done examining the properties of the current rule, press TAB to move to the Close button and press ENTER to return to the viewer. Select the Close button once more to exit the viewer and return to the browser.

Using Other JAWS Features on a Web Page Where Flexible Web Rules are Applied

Where applicable, other JAWS features such as PlaceMarkers, Custom Page Summary, and Personalized Settings will continue to be in effect for a page where Flexible Web rules have been applied to it. This depends on whether a setting applied as a Flexible Web rule conflicts with a setting that is not a Flexible Web rule. For example, if you have created a PlaceMarker for a page that is located on an element that has now been hidden because a Flexible Web rule has been applied to that page, the PlaceMarker will not be found when you attempt to move to it.

For pages that automatically update information frequently, any Flexible Web rules applied will still be in effect as the page updates. Additionally, if a page automatically sets focus to a control, such as an edit field for searching, this takes precedence over any rules that start reading at a specific element.

When selecting and copying text from a Web page where Flexible Web rules have been applied, if Select and Copy Full Content Using Onscreen Highlight is selected in Quick Settings, all content is copied, including any hidden content that was included in the selection. If you do not want to include any hidden content when selecting, choose the Select and Copy from Virtual Cursor option.

Turning Off Flexible Web

Flexible Web is on by default. To turn it off so rules are not applied when pages load, do the following:

1.    Press INSERT+F2, and select Settings Center.

2.    Press CTRL+SHIFT+D to load the JAWS default settings.

3.    In the Search edit box, type "Flexible Web" without the quotes.

4.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to Flexible Web in the filtered search results in the tree view.

5.    Next, press SPACEBAR to enable or disable Flexible Web.

JAWS Commands for MAGic

When using MAGic with JAWS, use JAWS keystrokes to control speech, and use MAGic keystrokes to control magnification. There are no other keystrokes that you need to use the applications simultaneously.

 

 

  ------ --- ------
  Back       Next
  ------ --- ------

MAGic Getting Started

To run MAGic with JAWS, you must first install JAWS. MAGic and JAWS determine whether they are running at the same time. If MAGic and JAWS are running concurrently, JAWS handles all speech commands. MAGic temporarily disables all speech functions, which makes the Speech menu and buttons found on the MAGic user interface unavailable. Use JAWS hot keys to utilize speech functionality. MAGic continues to magnify your display, and all commands for magnification remain unchanged.

Note: When you launch MAGic while JAWS is running, you will lose any temporary verbosity changes that you have made. If you make temporary verbosity changes in JAWS while MAGic is running, after you close MAGic, those settings will again be lost. This only affects temporary settings; it does not affect settings saved in the JAWS managers, or settings that are normally saved beyond the current JAWS session.

 

  ------ --- ------
  Back       Next
  ------ --- ------

MAGic Helpful Hints

MAGic allows you to select which key is used as the MAGic Key. JAWS provides the same flexibility for the JAWS Key. When the two products are used together, it is important that the MAGic Key and the JAWS key are not assigned to the same key. If they are assigned to the same key, any JAWS commands assigned to a key combination using the JAWS Key are not activated when the key combination is pressed.

General Notes

Features

·         Sub forms and main forms are identified when pressing TAB or CTRL+TAB to move between them.

·         When typing text that is auto completed, such as when entering text in a lookup field or macro entry, JAWS will automatically read the completed text.

·         When adding controls to a form or report with the SelectToolboxControl command (CTRL+SHIFT+B, Access 2003 only), a label control is automatically created along with the selected control.

·         When listing form controls, JAWS shows the disabled and visible status.

·         At beginner verbosity, JAWS will automatically select an item if a folder or file is not selected when BACKSPACE or ENTER is pressed in the Open or Save As list views in these dialogs.

Using Control Wizards

When you add a control to a form or report with the Select Toolbox Control command (CTRL+SHIFT+B, Access 2003 only), the Access wizard for that control is not displayed. Wizards can help you configure controls to work better with your form or report. If you want to access the wizard when adding a control, ensure that the Control Wizard button is selected in the Toolbox before you add the control.

Supported Screens

The next sections contain information specifically for some of the screens supported.

Design Views

The following information may be helpful when using specific screens:

Table Design View

The Table Design view has two panels. The top panel allows you to specify the field name, data type and size of each field in your table. The second panel allows you to set properties for the selected field in the top panel.

Define at least one field to switch panels. Use F6 to switch between the field definition panel and the field properties multi-page dialog. As you press the TAB key, JAWS will announce the prompt and setting in both panels and display this information on your Braille display.

To exit the Table Design view, press CTRL+F4.

There are special JAWS keystrokes that are used to read a table. See Using JAWS to Navigate Tables.

Note: In Access, pressing ALT+CTRL+UP or DOWN ARROW moves you to the first or last cell in the current column instead of moving you to the cell above or below your current position. This is an Access keyboard command.

Query Design View

When the Query Design view is displayed, a dialog opens and you can choose the tables and fields you wish to work with. Select these items using the add button, and then press the close button to open the Design View.

The Design View consists of two panels. The top panel contains a list of the items just selected in the previous step, while the lower panel contains a grid with headings down the left-hand side.

Press F6 to switch between these panels. Also, ensure the application is maximized (ALT+MINUS, X) so that field names are spoken as you move from grid row to grid row.

To select a field and/or table from the list in the top panel, use your Arrow keys to locate an item, and then press ENTER to place the item on the grid. JAWS announces that it is placing the item on the grid.

If for some reason your cursor gets stuck, locate the JAWS cursor in the grid or list, and click the left mouse button (NUM PAD /) to refocus.

Use CTRL+SHIFT+J (Access 2003 only) to create a join in the Query Design View grid. See JAWS Specific Keystrokes for Access for details about using this keystroke. This function only works in the Query Design View grid, and is subject to the normal Access constraints.

To exit this screen, press CTRL+F4.

Form and Report Design Views

When you are using the Form and Report Design Views, the TAB key allows you to move between sections.

Use ENTER to bring up the properties for any section.

CTRL+SHIFT+B (Access 2003 only) gives you a list of controls in the standard toolbox. Use ENTER to select one of these controls. To set the properties for a control, use the Object combo button on the Format toolbar. Then select the control for which you want to set properties, press ENTER, and then choose Properties from the View menu.

Note: A label control is automatically created for any control you add to the form or report. Set the labels caption property for JAWS to read the correct label in Forms view.

To return to the Section Selector, choose the section from the Object combo box, and press ENTER.

Macro Creation Screen

To create a new macro, select New. Focus is placed in the Action column of the design grid. Press TAB to go to the comment column, and then press F6 to switch to the properties multi-page dialog. Press CTRL+F4 to close this screen.

Notes to Database Designers and Application Programmers

JAWS uses a standard method of associating labels with their controls on a form. To ensure that JAWS correctly identifies a control label, use one of the following methods:

1.    Set the control’s caption property to the text describing the control.

Note: If the SelectToolboxControl or the real Toolbox are used to add a control to a form or report then this will automatically be done. If however, a control is created by a macro or Visual Basic command, then the programmer is responsible for creating the separate label and assigning the Parent property correctly.

2.    Set the control’s ToolTip Text property to the text describing the control.

3.    If you create a separate label control for another control, set its parent property to point to the control it is labeling. JAWS will look at the parent’s name property and match it with the name property of the control for which the label is associated.

If Label Search is off, only the first two methods can be used to determine a label for the control. Otherwise, JAWS will look at each control on the form whose Control Type property is not (Access) AcLabel to see if the label parent name matches that control name. If it does, then the label control caption is used as the label for the control.

Note: The SpeakDatabaseSummary command (CTRL+SHIFT+D, Access 2003 only) ignores objects whose names either start with Msys or that contain a ~ (tilde) character. These objects are maintained by Microsoft Access and are not visible. Please do not name user objects in this way. JAWS will ignore them when this command is selected.

General Notes

The following general information may be of help to you when using Access with JAWS:

·         You must maximize the screen in order for prompts to be spoken in the Table Design view grid.

·         Wizard text from the parent form is still spoken even when a sub-form has appeared with possibly more text. The additional sub-form text is spoken after the main forms text.

·         When an option group (group box) is displayed on the Braille display, you cannot use routing buttons to access the group objects.

·         You cannot select controls on a sub-sub form using CTRL+SHIFT+L (Access 2003 only).

·         When trying to focus on a control within an Option group, and its state is spoken (CTRL+SHIFT+L), the state may be inaccurate. To hear the correct state, focus on the group box itself, and then press INSERT+TAB.

·         If the table or database summary keys seem to give information that is not up-to-date, for example, it speaks the name of a table that you have already deleted, it may be necessary to shut down and restart Microsoft Access.

·         If you get a message that a control was not created, when trying to add controls to a form or report in Design View using CTRL+SHIFT+B, it may be that the parent control cannot accommodate child controls until you adjust the size properties. You may get this message when trying to add controls to a group box (Option Group).

·         When you delete a relationship with CTRL+DELETE, the relationship is not removed from the screen until the window is closed and reopened. Since it has been deleted, JAWS reports that the relationship status is correct.

·         The advanced wizards that may be installed for Access have not been directly supported in this release of JAWS, although they are useable. You may find that some of the control labels are not located correctly. Remember to use the help facilities built into these scripts, INSERT+F1, INSERT+H, and INSERT+DELETE.

·         Sometimes CTRL+SHIFT+R (Access 2003 only) does not read the whole active report. The best way to get around this problem is to export the report as HTML and read it in your Web browsing software.

Excel Options

In Microsoft Excel, JAWS provides a high level of flexibility so you may work in the way you find most comfortable. Many of the settings are located in the Quick Settings tree view. These settings determine what types of information and how much of it you hear. Excel settings are saved across sessions once you set them, and several are saved for the files in which you set them. To change your current settings while using Excel, press INSERT+V.

This topic describes the options specific to the Excel Settings group in Quick Settings. For information on JAWS settings that can be configured for multiple applications, refer to the Adjusting JAWS Options topic.

Formatting Group

Use the options in this group to control which cell formatting changes are detected.

Number format and style changes indication

When toggled on, this option lets JAWS announce the number format value when formatting changes from one cell to another. For example, if you navigate from a cell that is formatted for currency into a cell formatted for percentage, JAWS will say the word "percentage" after saying the number in the second cell. The default is off.

Cell Appearance Options Group

Use the options in this group to control whether cell appearance changes are detected.

Border Changes Indication

This option lets JAWS detect and announce changes in cell borders as you navigate a workbook. The default is off.

Monitoring Cells Group

This group contains options for reading monitor cells and their associated titles.

Monitor cell titles read

This option controls whether to read column and row titles of a monitor cell when you request to read the content of that cell. The default setting is On.

 

Workbook Settings Group

Use the option in this group to control workbook settings.

Workbook Settings

This option controls whether workbook settings are set for the settings file to be an exact match of the current file name, or a best match for the current file name. The default is exact match.

Reading Options Group

The following options, which are specific to Microsoft Excel, control how JAWS behaves when reading and navigating cells. It also contains options that control how JAWS behaves when reading and navigating text.

Cell Verbosity

This option controls whether to announce both cell content and coordinates or only cell content as cells are navigated. The default setting is to announce both cell content and coordinates.

Selection Verbosity

This option controls whether to announce the content of all cells in a selected range or the content of only the first and last cells in the range. The default setting is to announce the content of the first and last cell in the selected range.

Filtered Columns and Rows Detection

This option controls whether to detect filtered columns and rows as the cells in the currently active worksheet are navigated. The default setting is Off.

When the option is on and filtering is enabled for the current worksheet, JAWS tells you when you have selected a cell whose column or row is filtered. If you navigate within the same column or row, JAWS does not repeat this information. But if you move to a new column and new row, such as from the GoTo dialog box, JAWS announces what columns or rows are filtered for the cell that has just gained focus.

Filtered columns and rows may not be filtered consecutively. You could have Columns c, E, and G filtered or you could have columns C through G filtered. The same is true for rows. JAWS attempts to tell you whether the cell that has just gained focus is within a filtered row or column, or whether the rows or columns that are filtered are nonconsecutive. When the range of columns or rows is nonconsecutive, you can open Screen-sensitive Help (INSERT+F1) to get a complete list of the filtered items.

Hyperlink Address Announcement

This option determines how much detail is announced for links that point to other cells within an Excel document. The default setting is off.

If a cell contains a link to another cell in a worksheet, JAWS announces the worksheet name and the cell reference when this option is on. If the link points to a Web site or e-mail external to the Excel document, JAWS only states that the cell contains a link.

Object Count Detection

This option controls whether JAWS detects and announces the number of embedded objects in the currently active worksheet. When used, JAWS announces the number of objects as you open a worksheet, add a worksheet using the Insert Ribbon or menu, or switch between worksheets within the same workbook. This setting is on by default.

Page Breaks Detection

Use this option to detect page breaks while moving through the current document. In general, this option should remain off. However, if you need to check where page breaks may occur when printing a document, it is helpful to use it for that workbook. The option is workbook-specific. This means that when it is on for one workbook, it may not be on for another workbook. The default setting is off.

The types of page breaks that can be detected include horizontal, vertical, or manual page breaks. In addition to the ability to detect page breaks as the worksheet is navigated, you can bring up a page break list of horizontal and vertical page breaks by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B. This feature is available whether page breaks detection is on or not.

If a manual page break is set for a column or row, it means that the page break applies to that entire column or row. As you continue to navigate along the same column or row, JAWS will not continue to inform you that this column or row has a manual page break. But if you move off the column or row where it is located and then return to that column or row, JAWS once again alerts you that this column or row has a manual page break.

If a manual page break occurs on a particular column and row, JAWS alerts you about the intersection, that is, that this manual page break is both at the current column and current row.

Custom Summary Labels

This option controls whether or not JAWS uses custom summary labels for custom summary views previously defined in Microsoft Excel.

When the Custom Summary Labels option is On, you can assign and manipulate custom summary labels for the current workbook by using the command normally used to create a custom label, INSERT+CTRL+TAB. When the Custom Summary Labels option is off, the feature is simply not available. If you attempt to create a custom summary label for a cell in the worksheet, or attempt to view a custom summary of previously defined custom summary labels, an error message is heard. Turning the feature off only works temporarily. When the application regains focus from moving away and back or closing and restarting Excel, or even changing worksheets or workbooks, custom Summary Labels is available once again. The default setting is on.

Blank Cell Announcement

This option controls whether JAWS says "blank" when encountering empty cells as you navigate spreadsheets. This check box is selected by default.

Braille Options Group

This group contains options specific to Microsoft Excel that control your Braille display while on a spreadsheet.

Braille Mode

This option controls whether the braille display shows the active cell, the current row, or the current column. The default setting is to show the active cell.

Workbook, Worksheet, and Region Settings group

These settings are saved for the active workbook, its worksheets, and regions.

Formatting Group

This group contains options that control which cell formatting changes are detected in the active workbook, its worksheets, and regions.

Font, Color, and Attribute Changes Indication

If font attributes change from one cell to another, JAWS announces the font name, size, color, and so on as you navigate cells in a workbook when this option is toggled on. The default is off.

Title Cell Font and Formatting Indication

This option controls whether or not JAWS displays font and formatting information in the Virtual Viewer for the title cell associated with the currently active cell. This setting is off by default.

Format Conditions Detection

When toggled on, JAWS announces if format conditions are applied to a cell. The default is off.

Cell Appearance Group

This group contains options that control whether cell appearance changes are detected in the active workbook, its worksheets, and regions.

Cell Text Visibility Detection

This worksheet specific option controls whether to detect that cell text is cropped or overlapping other cells. The default is off.

Orientation indication

This option controls whether to indicate the orientation of a cell as you navigate around the current worksheet. The setting is worksheet-specific. If the number indicated is positive, rotation is upward or counterclockwise. If negative, the rotation is downward or clockwise. By default, this setting is off.

Shading Changes Indication

This option controls whether to detect changes in shading as cells are navigated. The default is off.

Title Reading Options Group

Use the options in this group to control title reading detection for rows and columns.

Define Name Column and Row Titles Override

This option controls whether to override detection of any Define Name Column and Row Titles contained in the current worksheet or workbook. The default is off, which means that JAWS detects Define Name column and row titles if they exist and are of the form JAWS recognizes. However, if JAWS detects that you have assigned titles manually in a settings file; those user-assigned settings supersede the ones that are part of the Excel file itself.

For JAWS to be able to detect such user-defined settings, you need to override Define Name Column and Row Titles. The options are:

·         On for all files: JAWS overrides detection of any document named titles that may exist in any worksheet or workbook. None are read unless you manually set them and save them in a settings file.

·         On only for the current file: JAWS overrides any document named titles that may exist in the current worksheet or workbook, but does detect them in other workbooks.

Regions Type Indication

This option controls whether to detect the current worksheet as having a single region or multiple regions for purposes of column and row title reading. The default is single region. This setting can only be changed manually if the Define Name Column and Row Titles Override option is turned on for all files or for the current file. When set to multiple, if a worksheet contains two or more regions, JAWS will announce when you enter a different cell region while navigating the worksheet. When set to single, JAWS does not announce when you move into a different region since the entire worksheet is considered to be one single region. The default is single region.

Title Reading Detection

This worksheet specific option controls whether title reading is on for both columns and rows, on only for columns, on only for rows, or off altogether. The default is off. This setting can only be changed manually if the Define Name Column and Row Titles Override option is turned on for all files or for the current file.

Titles Read For

This worksheet specific option controls whether column and row titles should be read for any data cell, or only when cells are to the right and below title cells . The default is to read titles only when cells are to the right and below title cells.

Column Titles to Row Range Set

This worksheet specific option lets you define the currently selected cell or group of cells as a title row. Before using this feature, you first need to change the default setting for the Define Name Column and Row Titles Override option. It is off by default, which means that JAWS honors named titles for columns and rows already present in the worksheet, if such named titles exist. The named titles must be of a certain form in order that JAWS recognize them. To learn more about how to use Define Name Column and Row Titles, see Excel Row and Column Title Reading.

To set the current title row(s), first move up to the Define Name Column and Row Titles option in the list. Then press SPACEBAR to toggle the override on. Choose either "On for all files" or "On for the current file". Now move back down the list to define the current title row(s) and press SPACEBAR. Press ENTER to save the setting changes you have made.

Row Titles to Column Range Set

This worksheet specific option lets you define the currently selected cell or group of cells as a title column. Before using this feature, you first need to change the default setting for the Define Name Column and Row Titles Override option. It is off by default, which means that JAWS honors named titles for columns and rows already present in the worksheet, if such named titles exist. The named titles must be of a certain form for JAWS to recognize them. To learn more about how to use Define Name Column and Row Titles, see Excel Row and Column Title Reading.

To set the current title column(s), first move up to the Define Name Column and Row Titles option in the list. Then press SPACEBAR to toggle the override on. Choose either "On for all files" or "On for the current file". Next, move down the list to define the current title column(s) and press SPACEBAR. Press ENTER to save your changes.

Totals Column Set

This worksheet specific option lets you set the current column as the totals column for the current worksheet or region. The default is Auto, which means the column is assumed to be the last column with data.

Totals Row Set

This worksheet specific option lets you set the current row as the totals row for the current worksheet or region. The default is Auto, which means the totals row is assumed to be the last row with data.

Clear Title and Total Definitions

This worksheet specific option lets you clear all column and row title definitions as well as total column and total row definitions for the current worksheet as long as those definitions are not document named titles.

Monitoring Cell Assignments Group

Use the settings in this group to set or clear up to ten monitor cells. Monitor cells are worksheet-specific. For more information on setting monitor cells, refer to the Monitor Cells in Excel topic.

Use the Monitor Cells Clear option to clear all monitor cell definitions for the current worksheet. Activating this option clears all ten monitor cell settings immediately, though the displayed assignment for each will not be updated until Quick Settings is closed and reopened.

Properties of Cells Group

Use the options in this group to control which cell properties are detected.

Formulas Detection

This worksheet specific option controls whether to announce that a cell has a formula. The default is on.

Comments Detection

This worksheet specific option controls whether to announce that a cell has a comment. The default is on.

Merged Cells Detection

This option controls whether to announce that a group of cells is merged. The default is on.

Reading Options Group

This group contains worksheet-specific options that control how JAWS behaves when reading and navigating cells.

Form Controls Detection

This option controls whether JAWS detects form controls as the currently open worksheet is navigated. The default setting is off. Form controls include list boxes, check boxes, and other similar types of form controls.

Front Page Helpful Hints

FrontPage contains certain features that make authoring Web Pages quite simple. For example, when you use FrontPage to edit existing HTML and script projects created with other tools, FrontPage will preserve the original code, including tag, comment order, capitalization, and white space. You can also personalize HTML formatting by setting your preferences for how to indent code, what colors tags should appear in, when to capitalize, and when to use optional tags. When you create or import content, FrontPage will apply your preferences. In Normal view, or WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) view, you can use the Reveal HTML Tags option to see the tags that are responsible for your page effects.

An easy way to view the layout, including all the form controls of your Web page is to press CTRL+SHIFT+B to preview in browser. To learn more about navigating in an HTML table see Using JAWS to Navigate Tables.

The Page View, allows you to edit as you would in Microsoft Word. You can use many of the same keystrokes, such as bold, italic, underline, alignment, left and right justify, and center. Pressing INSERT+F will speak font, point size and attribute as it does by default. The alignment will not be spoken. Not all the material that can be read on the page can be edited. It is not uncommon to press the DOWN ARROW key to move to a line that says, for example: Submit Reset, however, you cannot get to the Submit or Reset with the PC Cursor, as these are not editable. To edit the content of these controls, simply switch to the HTML view with a CTRL+PAGE DOWN. These control types only appear after you have inserted them via the Form Wizard, or by editing the HTML source yourself. The normal view in FrontPage respects all code that is added and/or removed in the HTML view.

Outlook Getting Started

There are no special installation or setup requirements to run Outlook with JAWS. Simply start the program using normal procedures. Refer to the product’s online help system as required, using ALT+H to select the software’s built in help topics. If you need assistance with JAWS keystrokes or want to know what new features have been added that JAWS supports, use INSERT+F1+F1.

Customizing an Outlook Message List

Note: Although this topic describes functionality for Mail in Outlook, the same information and procedures can be applied to Outlook's Calendar, Contacts list, Tasks list, and Notes.

An Outlook message list is a list box that contains e-mail messages. The Inbox, Sent Items, and Junk E-mail list boxes are examples of message lists. These lists typically contain multiple columns, such as From, Subject, and Received, that provide information about each e-mail message. (See Column Header Descriptions for a brief explanation of the various message list columns available. See JAWS Commands for Outlook for a quick list of keystrokes.)

The Customize Outlook Message List feature lets you arrange the order and change how JAWS provides these details with speech and braille. For example, you can:

·         Change the order in which JAWS reads columns.

·         Tell JAWS not to speak certain columns or show them on your braille display.

·         Choose a voice alias that JAWS uses when reading column headers.

·         Choose whether JAWS should speak custom column headers or display them in braille.

To open the Outlook message list, do the following:

1.    Start Outlook.

2.    With focus in a message list, for example, the Inbox, press INSERT+F2. The Run JAWS Manager dialog box opens.

3.    Select Customize Outlook Message List and press ENTER. (For Calendar, Contacts, and Notes, select Customize List View.)
 The Customize Outlook Message List dialog box opens; the Speech page is active. Press CTRL+TAB to open the Braille page.

4.    To listen to message list settings, do one of the following:
 
 Press UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW to select items in the list view. JAWS reads the contents of the selected row, or
 
 Press CTRL+INSERT+1 through 0, which represents columns 1 through 10 in the list view, to have JAWS read the contents of a specific column for the message that is currently selected in the message list. For example, if the first e-mail message in the Inbox is selected and you press CTRL+INSERT+7, JAWS will announce the sender of the e-mail message using the information in the From column.

Tip: If you have customized a list view so that certain columns are not spoken, you can press INSERT+PAGE UP to read the information in all columns for the selected item.

Changing Column Order

JAWS reads the columns listed in the Column Headers dialog box from top to bottom. To change the order in which JAWS announces the columns of a list view, do the following:

1.    On the Speech page, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select a column.

2.    Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the position of the column in the list. JAWS reads columns at the top of the list first.

3.    Press CTRL+TAB to switch to the Braille page, which shows the column list order for braille.

4.    Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select a column from the list.

5.    Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the position of the column in the list. JAWS displays columns at the top of the list in braille first.

6.    Choose the OK button.

Toggling Speech and Braille for Columns

If you do not want JAWS to read a certain column or display it in braille, do the following:

1.    On the Speech page, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select the column.

2.    Choose the Toggle Speech button. This sets the behavior for the column to "Do Not Speak." You can choose this button again to change the behavior back to "Speak Column."

3.    Press CTRL+TAB to switch to the Braille page and select the column from the list.

4.    Choose the Toggle Braille button. This sets the behavior for the column to "Do Not Braille." You can choose this button again to change the behavior back to "Braille Column."

5.    Choose the OK button.

Selecting a Voice Alias for Column Headers

To assign a voice alias to the titles of columns in a list view, do the following:

1.    Choose the Select Voice Alias button.

2.    Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select the voice alias that you want JAWS to use when reading column headings or custom text.

3.    Choose the OK button. The selected voice alias appears in the Data column.

4.    Choose the OK button.

Assigning Custom Text to Columns

You can have JAWS read or display in braille custom text instead of, or in addition to, the column header text. To enter custom text and define how JAWS announces column headers, do the following:

1.    On the Speech page, use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select the column you want to assign custom text to.

2.    In the Custom Text edit box, type the text that you want JAWS to announce when reading the column. You can repeat steps 1 and 2 to assign different text to each column header.

3.    In the Column Headers area, select one of the following radio buttons:

o   Ignore - JAWS does not read column headers or custom text in list views.

o   Speak Custom Text OR Header - If you assigned custom text to a column, JAWS reads this text instead of the column header. If you have not assigned any custom text, JAWS reads the column header.

o   Speak Custom Text AND Header - JAWS reads the column header and any custom text that you have assigned.

o   Speak Custom Text Only - JAWS only reads custom text assigned to columns and does not read the column headers.

4.    If you want JAWS to display any custom text in braille, press CTRL+TAB to switch to the Braille page.

5.    Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select the column you want to assign custom text to.

6.    In the Custom Text edit box, type the text that you want JAWS to display in braille when reading the column. You can repeat steps 5 and 6 to assign different text to each column header.

7.    In the Column Headers area, select one of the following radio buttons:

o   Ignore - JAWS does not display column headers or custom text in braille.

o   Braille Custom Text OR Header - If you assigned custom text to a column, JAWS displays this text in braille instead of the column header. If you have not assigned any custom text, JAWS displays the column header.

o   Braille Custom Text AND Header - JAWS displays the column header and any custom text that you have assigned.

o   Braille Custom Text Only - JAWS only displays custom text assigned to columns and does not display the column headers.

8.    Choose the OK button.

Column Header Descriptions

The following briefly describes the various Outlook column headers. The headers will vary based on the Outlook message list that is open.

·         Importance: JAWS announces if a message is marked as having high, normal, or low importance.

·         Reminder: JAWS announces the message reminder status.

·         Icon: Outlook uses graphics to identify a message by its current state or type, for example, if it is a read or unread message, an Out of Office Auto Reply, a successful or unsuccessful Recall Report, a meeting cancellation, request, or acceptance.

·         Flag Status: JAWS announces the follow up flag status of the message, for example, unflagged, red flag, and so on.

·         Attachment: JAWS announces the number of items attached to a message.

·         From: JAWS announces the message sender's name as it appears in the From column.

·         To: JAWS announces the message recipient's name as it appears in the To column.

·         Subject: JAWS announces the message's subject.

·         Received: JAWS announces the time and date that the message was received.

·         Sent: JAWS announces the time and date that the message was sent.

·         Size: JAWS announces the message size.

·         Categories: JAWS announces the category color associated with a message.

·         Header Status: JAWS announces the status as read, unread, forwarded, or replied.

Outlook Helpful Hints

The following are some helpful hints for using Outlook with JAWS.

Outlook Reading Pane

When using JAWS, the Outlook Reading Pane must be set to the bottom of the window or disabled. If the Reading Pane is set to the right, it forces the Message List Headers into Two-line mode, and only the first line is announced.

To set the Reading Pane to the bottom of the window, or to disable it, do the following:

1.    Open Outlook.

2.    Press ALT+V to choose the View tab (Outlook 2010 or later) or View menu.

3.    Choose Reading Pane.

4.    Select Bottom to set the pane to the bottom of the window, or select Off to disable the reading pane.

Outlook Options

While working in Outlook, you can press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings and change JAWS options that are specific to Outlook. For more information on how to use Quick Settings as well as the standard JAWS options that are not described in this section, see Quick Settings.

Message Follow-Up Flag Indication

When turned on, JAWS announces if a follow-up flag has been applied to the selected e-mail message. The default setting is Off.

Message Forwarded Flag Indication

When turned on, JAWS announces if a forward flag has been applied to the selected e-mail message. The default setting is Off.

Use Virtual Cursor for Read-Only Messages

Use this option to have JAWS render read-only messages in the virtual buffer. E-mail messages that contain complex tables and formatting are often difficult to read when using Outlook 2007 or later. This is due to Word being used to render the HTML content. By default, this setting is enabled and read-only messages will be rendered in the virtual buffer for ease of reading. Disable this option if you want to interact directly with the Word Editor rather than reading the message in the Virtual Buffer.

Address List Auto-Complete Announcement

When you type an e-mail address into the To, CC, or BCC edit boxes, Outlook searches for matches in your address book and then automatically completes the entry for you. JAWS will now announce the address that Outlook automatically inserts into the edit box. To disable this feature, press INSERT+V, select "Address List Auto-Complete Announcement," and press the SPACEBAR to choose Off.

Information Bar Messages Announcement

In Outlook, the information bar frequently displays useful status information. For example, this bar informs you when attachments have been removed from a message, which account a message will be sent from, when you last replied to the current message, when the appointment/meeting you are creating conflicts with an existing appointment, when an appointment time has passed, and so on. If you want JAWS to automatically announce the contents of the information bar when reading messages, leave this option set to On.

Message Header Fields Announce with Message Announcement

If this option is set to On, then JAWS automatically reads the From and Subject fields when you open a message. If you change this option to Off, then JAWS does not automatically read this information.

Message Type Announcement

When turned on, JAWS announces the sender's message type, for example, HTML or Plain Text. The default setting is Off.

Link Count Announcement

If you open an e-mail message containing links and this option is turned on, JAWS indicates the number of links that appear in the message. The default setting is On.

Messages Automatically Read

If you want JAWS to automatically read the message body from beginning to end, change this option to On. If you do not want JAWS to automatically read the message body after reading the message header, then leave this option set to Off.

Tip: When reading messages automatically, the cursor may move faster than JAWS speech. If you stop speech with CTRL, you should press CTRL+HOME to move to the beginning of the message before continuing to read.

Optimizing Outlook

The following are choices and suggestions for optimizing Outlook options for use with JAWS:

Calendar

Press CTRL+2 to move to the Calendar view. You can use the folowing keystrokes to select one of four views:

·         Day, CTRL+ALT+1

·         Work Week, CTRL+ALT+2

·         Week, CTRL+ALT+3

·         Month, CTRL+ALT+4

In all views, use LEFT and RIGHT ARROW to move between the days of the month. In Day, Week, or Work Week view, use UP and DOWN ARROW to move between the different time slots for the current day. In Month view, use UP and DOWN ARROW to move through weeks. Press TAB or SHIFT+TAB to cycle through your appointments for the current day. To open an appointment, select it and press ENTER. Pressing INSERT+CTRL+D announces the currently focused date and view in the calendar. Press INSERT+F1 while focused in the calendar for a complete list of available commands for managing appointments.

Note: If you have upgraded to the latest version of Office 2016, you may have noticed that JAWS reads date and appointment info differently than in prior versions of Outlook. Beginning with the July 2016 update for Office, Microsoft has changed the way calendar information is provided. In Outlook 2016 and later, JAWS now announces and displays in braille calendar info exactly the way it is received directly from Microsoft.

Tasks

Tasks in Outlook are very similar to appointments and reminders. Pressing F6 in Outlook moves focus to several different parts of the screen, depending on what view is active at the current time. When you are in the email view, pressing F6 moves focus to the following areas, starting from the email list view:

·         Preview pane (if open)

·         To-Do bar (if turned on in the ribbon)

·         Status bar

·         Upper ribbon

·         Mail folders tree view

·         Back to the list view of emails

To access To-Do items, press CTRL+4 to switch to the To-Do list view. This puts all tasks and flags in one vertical column, making it easier to navigate. To open any task or flag from the list, just press ENTER on the item in the list.

Contacts

Press CTRL+3 to move to the Contacts view. To change how contacts are displayed, press ALT+H to go to the Home tab of the ribbon and then press C, followed by V, to activate the Change View button. You can choose Business Card, Card, Phone, or List. All of these views work with JAWS. Press INSERT+F1 while focused in the Contacts view for a complete list of available commands for working with contacts.

Reading MSAA Information

If you find that the selected item is abbreviated or not read completely by JAWS, press ALT+CTRL+SHIFT+M to read the MSAA (Microsoft Active Accessibility) information for that item. MSAA provides more details to JAWS, so it can read all the information available.

Visual Basic for Applications

JAWS only partially supports Visual Basic for Applications when launched from within Outlook.

PowerPoint Helpful Hints

Overview of the PowerPoint Screen

The PowerPoint window has the usual Title bar, Menu bar, Standard and Formatting toolbars and Status bar that nearly all Windows applications have, and many of the features on the toolbars are very similar to those of Microsoft Word.

The main PowerPoint screen, which is called the "Normal View," is divided into three panes, each pane serving a different function. This lets the user switch between a variety of tasks quickly and easily. The first pane is called "Slide View" and shows the current slide. The next pane, called "Notes Page View," provides space for the user to add any personal notes that refer to the slide currently being shown. The last pane, called "Outline View", shows the text that appears in the current slide. As text is added directly into the slide, it automatically appears in the outline view. Alternatively, any changes made to the text in the outline view are automatically reflected in the slide view. Pressing the function key F6 moves us between each of these three sections in turn until we have wrapped around to the beginning again.

Levels of Navigation in PowerPoint

In Normal view in PowerPoint, there are two levels of navigation. The first level is identified by JAWS as the Object Level and means that you can navigate between the objects on the slide using the TAB or SHIFT+TAB key. At the Object Level, JAWS will tell you about the whole object selected. To repeat the selected object’s description, use the INSERT+TAB key combination.

The second navigational level is called the Edit Level. Once you navigate to an object on a slide in either Normal or Slide view and press ENTER, you are at the Edit Level. At this level you are free to edit the text associated with the selected object. Navigation is then restricted to the text within the selected object.

Note:  When using larger font sizes, JAWS may only inconsistently report information at the insertion point. To correct this, adjust the zoom settings under the View menu to 75% or 50%. This only happens at the edit level; it does not occur at the object level.

Navigating with Placeholders

The first thing a new JAWS and PowerPoint user will notice is that JAWS attempts to describe each object as you Tab to it at the object level. Because there are many kinds of objects, the JAWS vocabulary has been extended to include many new types of objects. For example: when you Tab to the spot on the slide where a title is supposed to be entered, JAWS will describe this as a Title Placeholder. The terms that JAWS uses are taken from the PowerPoint documentation, so familiarity with these terms is useful. In general, the term that JAWS uses to describe a place on the slide, aside from a particular object type, is called a Placeholder.

JAWS will also describe other concepts such as the Entry Effect or Animation Text for slides and objects. These terms are further described in the PowerPoint documentation.

·         To move to the next Placeholder, press CTRL+ENTER

Note: When the last Placeholder on a slide is selected, press CTRL+ENTER to insert a new slide in the presentation.

·         To repeat the last Find action press SHIFT+F4

All AutoShape and Placeholder objects are described (and shown on the Braille display) by JAWS. JAWS will also read text associated with any shape even if it is scrolling, sideways, rotated, etc. Press CTRL+SHIFT+O to list the objects on the current slide.

Working in Outline View

To hear the levels in the Outline view use INSERT+TAB or ALT+SHIFT+LEFT OR RIGHT ARROW. To promote or demote the level use TAB and SHIFT+TAB. If the PC Cursor is active you can use ALT+SHIFT+LEFT or RIGHT ARROW. When using INSERT+F, JAWS now reports the paragraph level as part of the description of the text.

Outline View and Powerpoint XP

In Powerpoint XP, maximize the Powerpoint window, ALT+SPACEBAR, X, and maximize Powerpoint child windows, ALT+MINUS, X, and cascade the Powerpoint child windows to ensure JAWS reads all information in the Outline View window. The option to cascade the Powerpoint child windows is located in the Windows menu.

If you move away from the Powerpoint application window with ALT+TAB, when you return to it, the Powerpoint child windows are no longer maximized. Press ALT+MINUS, X to again maximize each of the Powerpoint child windows.

JAWS and OLE Objects

JAWS will recognize the following embedded OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects when inserted into a slide:

·         Excel Worksheet

·         Excel Chart

·         MS Graph Chart

·         Paint Picture

·         MS Clipart

·         Word Document / Tables

·         PowerPoint Presentation and Slide

If you bring any of the above objects into focus from the top level by pressing TAB to move to them and pressing ENTER, you can get back to the top level by pressing ESC at which point you will be able to TAB to other objects on the slide. Press INSERT+F1 to hear information about the current object.

If JAWS does not know what kind of embedded object is on the slide, it will tell you its name and if it does not have one, it will tell you which application was used to create the object.

Verbosity Items to Note

JAWS will now remember your Verbosity settings for all PowerPoint specific Verbosity settings across sessions.

Alert When Text Placeholder Overflow Occurs

JAWS’ feature, Text Overflow Detection, will tell you when too much information is in a placeholder. Press INSERT+F1 to hear this information, if you do not have this verbosity item turned on. JAWS will also tell you the approximate number of lines that are left based on the last font size used. This feature is turned on by default.

Alert When Objects Overlap

Object Overlap Detection is similar to Text Overflow Detection, but tells you when objects on the slide overlap. This item is also on by default.

Announce Slide Transitions

JAWS announces transition effects when you press PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN during a slide show. To disable this feature, press INSERT+V while in PowerPoint, select "Announce Slide Transitions," and press the SPACEBAR to choose "Off." When you are not viewing an active slide show, transition effects are always announced.

Describe Objects

JAWS provides a detailed description of objects in your presentation when it is not being viewed as an active slide show and you press PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN to move to the previous/next slide. If you do not want to hear these descriptions, press INSERT+V while in PowerPoint, select "Describe Objects," and press the SPACEBAR to choose "Off."

Slideshow Mode

JAWS uses the virtual cursor to navigate the slide show after you press F5. If you are on a bullet point and press either a routing button on the braille display or you press NUM PAD SLASH to press the left mouse button the visible pointer is routed to the end of the current bullet point. You may then use INSERT+F to report font information for that bullet point.

Speakers Notes

While you are in the Slide Show mode, you may read the Speaker's Notes. To toggle between the Slide Show and the Speaker's Notes, press CTRL+SHIFT+N. When you move between the Slide Show and the Speaker's Notes, the position of the virtual cursor is not retained.

Project Helpful Hints

General Navigation Information

Selecting Cells

Verbosity Items

Working With Outlines

Braille Support

Even though Microsoft Project is a graphically based interface, JAWS provides the necessary information quickly and efficiently. This should help the user who is dependant on a screen reader to be efficient in project management.

JAWS will read all views of Microsoft Project, except the Resource Graph View.

There are three types of views that are available:

·         Charts and Graphs,

·         Sheets, and

·         Forms

You can find more information on any of these views in the Microsoft Project Help files.

General Navigation Information

The default view is the Gantt Chart View. The Gantt Chart combines a chart of tasks and a graphical timeline. The columns and rows of the Chart section can be navigated using the ARROW KEYS and TAB/SHIFT+TAB. You can edit an entry by typing when it has focus, or by pressing F2 or ALT+DOWN ARROW for a list of options for the field (where available).

As you move from row to row, you will hear JAWS tell you the row ID, for example task 3 or resource 4.

For more information on navigating within tables see Using JAWS to Navigate Tables.

To switch panes in combination views, press F6. This will move between the top and bottom panes, and JAWS will report the active pane.

Selecting Cells

JAWS supports the three selection modes implemented by Microsoft Project:

1.    Extended Selection (use F8) allows you to navigate around and automatically add consecutive cells to the selection. Use F8 to toggle this off.

2.    You can press SHIFT+F8 to add the current cell to the selection (when selecting non-contiguous cells).

3.    You can use all the standard selection keystrokes such as SHIFT+LEFT or RIGHT ARROW, etc.

JAWS will report the cells being selected and you can get confirmation by using the standard SaySelectedText command SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW.

Verbosity Items

As you move between tasks and resources, JAWS will announce pertinent information about the selected task or resource that may not be displayed on the screen. The following Verbosity options have been developed to control how much of this information you hear.

Selection Verbosity – adjusts whether you hear all selected fields or only the first and last fields in the selection when SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW is pressed. The default setting is to hear all selected fields.

Verbosity Items Relating to Tasks and Resources

The following are turned on by default.

Status Information – Speaks information about the task or resource that is indicated graphically such as the task’s priority, whether the task is marked, is a mile stone, is a summary task, is on the critical path, percent work complete, or (if a task or a resource) has a response pending.

Task Outline Level – Alerts you when moving between tasks at different outline levels. Outline levels show whether a task is subordinate to another task, i.e. a subtask.

Notes Indicator – Alerts you when you move on to a task or resource for which there are notes.

Task Dependency Count – Automatically announces the current task’s number of predecessors (tasks on which this task depends) and successors (tasks which depend on this task) as you move from task to task.

Working with Outlines

You can promote and demote a task in task views using the standard Microsoft Office keystrokes ALT+SHIFT+LEFT or RIGHT ARROW. If the PC Cursor is active then the selected task will be promoted or demoted as expected, however if the JAWS cursor is active, then the default JAWS function of moving by the default mouse pixel value will be performed.

Braille Support

JAWS gives similar feedback in Braille to what is spoken as you navigate a task or resource table. As you move from task to task, the task ID, level, current cell name and value and status information are displayed in Structured Mode. The following Braille symbols indicate graphical information:

brlTaskLevel="l",
 brlMarked="x",
 brlCritical="c",
 brlPredecessors="<",
 brlSuccessors=">",
 brlMilestone="m",
 brlSummary="s",
 brlPercentComplete="% ",
 brlResponsePending="r"

An example of Braille output might be:
 t1l2 Task Name: Documentation 75% xc2<1>

This means that task 1 at outline level 2 has name Documentation, is 75% complete, is marked, is critical, has two predecessors and 1 successor. If a task or resource has notes then the notes will also be displayed after the status information.

Braille symbols aim to save space and be intuitive.

Navigation Quick Keys in Word

Jump directly to the quick key table on this page, or continue reading the following for an overview and guidelines about Navigation Quick Keys in Word.

Navigation Quick Keys provide you with an easy and efficient way to move through a document. You can quickly move the insertion point to a number of different page elements, including headings, tables, form fields, pages, sections, and more, with a simple keystroke. Navigation Quick Keys are automatically turned on while you are reading with the Say All command, but are automatically turned off when you open a Ribbon, menu, or dialog box in Word.

To turn on Navigation Quick Keys while in Word, do one of the following:

·         Press INSERT+Z (or CAPS LOCK+Z if configured for Laptop layout mode), or

·         Press INSERT+V, select Navigation Quick Keys, and press SPACEBAR to choose Quick Keys On.

Use the keystrokes in the Word Navigation Quick Keys table to move the insertion point to the next or previous element of the given type. JAWS says, "No more found," if there are no further elements of the given type or you have reached the end of the document. Note that in a protected Word form, the only quick keys available are P (page), and S (section). All others are disabled.

Use the SHIFT key in combination with a Navigation Quick Key to move to the previous element of that type in the document. For example, press SHIFT+H to move to the previous heading in the document.

While Navigation Quick Keys are on, you cannot type text into the document. In addition, you can only use the TAB, HOME, END, CTRL+HOME, and CTRL+END keys to move to the next form field or table cell. To determine if Navigation Quick Keys are enabled, press ALT+DELETE.

To turn off Navigation Quick Keys, press INSERT+Z. Note that JAWS also turns off Navigation Quick Keys if you switch to another document or program.

Using Navigation Quick Keys During Say All

Navigation Quick Keys are always available when reading with Say All (INSERT+DOWN ARROW). This lets you easily skip ahead or move backward through a document by heading, page, form field, bookmark, and so on without having to first turn on Navigation Quick Keys with INSERT+Z. To stop speech during Say All, simply press CTRL. Note that you cannot use the Navigation Quick Keys A and M while you are reading with the Say All command.

Word Navigation Quick Keys

The following table describes the Navigation Quick Keys available for Word. You can always change the current keystroke value using the Navigation Quick Key Manager.

Word Options

In Microsoft Word, JAWS provides a high level of flexibility so you may work in the way you find most comfortable. Many of the settings are located in the Quick Settings tree view. These settings determine what types of information and how much of it you hear. Word settings are saved across sessions once you set them, and several are saved for the files in which you set them. To change your current settings while using Word, press INSERT+V.

This topic describes the options specific to the Word Settings group in Quick Settings. For information on JAWS settings that can be configured for multiple applications, refer to the Adjusting JAWS Options topic.

Speech and Sound Schemes

This option controls whether the current scheme is active for all Word documents or specific Word documents.

If you allow schemes to be the same for all documents, JAWS applies the currently selected scheme to all Word documents. If you allow schemes to be document-specific, you can select a different scheme for each document. JAWS continues to apply the selected scheme to the document, even if you close the document or quit Word. You can select a scheme by pressing ALT+INSERT+S. Refer to Speech and Sounds Schemes Group for more information on schemes.

Formatting Group

This group controls which formatting changes are detected while reading a Microsoft Word document.

Bullet Type Indication

When you move to a paragraph formatted as a bulleted list, JAWS indicates the type of bullet used to create that list. JAWS can identify ten of the most common bullet types, including picture bullets. If you do not want JAWS to announce this information, turn this option off. The default is On.

F1 Help Prompt

This option controls whether to detect F1 help information for form fields, such as Help that has been written into the form template by its author. The option has three states:

·         Off: No F1 help prompt is announced when a form field containing F1 Help gains focus.

·         On: The message, "Press F1 for help" is announced when a form field that contains F1 help gains focus. This is the default setting.

·         Read with Form field: The F1 help message associated with a form field that contains F1 help is announced when the form field gains focus.

Headings Announce

This option controls how JAWS announces headings in Word documents. Select between the following:

·         Off

·         On

·         Heading and Level (default)

Note: If you want all styles to be indicated instead of just headings, choose the Style Changes option in the Formatting Options Group.

Measurement Units

This option allows you to set a desired unit of measure without affecting the application's current setting. For example, if the application is set to inches but centimeters is preferred, this option allows you to change the desired unit of measure so that indentation levels are read in that measurement unit. The default is whatever the application setting is for the current locale. In the U.S., this means the default is set to inches.

Shading Detection

This option controls whether to detect changes in shading while navigating table cells . The default is off.

Style Changes

This option controls whether to detect style changes while reading through the document. Select one of the following:

·         Off: Style changes are not announced as you navigate a document. This is the default setting.

·         Always announced: Style changes are announced regardless of what Speech and Sounds scheme is used.

·         Detected only by scheme: Style changes are announced when one of the Classic Speech and Sound schemes is active. Classic schemes include Classic, WordClassic, Classic with Quotes, etc.
 If Detected Only by Scheme is in effect, style changes are not announced when the scheme is something other than Classic. In that case, the scheme itself handles the way a style is detected. For example, in the proofreading with attributes scheme, headings are detected in a different voice, but the announcement of that style is not heard.

Tables Group

This group controls how JAWS behaves when reading and navigating tables in Microsoft Word.

This option detects and announces cell coordinates when navigating a table in Word. The default is on.

Table Detection

This option controls whether JAWS detects that you are entering or exiting a table while reading through the document. This means that when you enter a table, JAWS indicates this by announcing the table number, the number of rows and columns, cell content, and by displaying relevant table information in braille. When you exit a table,JAWS also indicates that the table has been exited. If the option is turned off, the table can still be navigated normally, but JAWS does not indicate when you enter or exit a table or anything about the table itself, its number, type, and the number of rows and columns it contains. The default setting is On.

Refer to Tables in Word for more information.

Description

This option controls whether descriptive information about the current table is announced as the table is navigated. This includes column and row position information for columns and rows that do not have a header associated with them. The default is on.

Editing Options Group

The options in this group control how JAWS behaves when editing text in Word documents.

AutoCorrect Detection

When this option is on, JAWS announces if the current word has been changed by the AutoCorrect feature. You can then press ALT+SHIFT+F10 to open a context menu that allows you to undo the correction, stop automatically correcting that word, or change your AutoCorrect options. The default setting is On.

New Lines and Paragraphs Indication

Select this option to have JAWS announce new lines and paragraph marks in a document. The default setting is Off. Before using this option, paragraph marks and other formatting symbols must first be visible in the document. In Word, press ALT+H, and then 8. Once this is done, select a setting for this option to determine if and how JAWS announces new line and paragraph marks as you read the document. Several choices are available for this item:

·         When typing: If text wraps to a new line while typing, the "new line" indication is announced.

·         When navigating: If navigating by character or word and text wraps to a new line, the "new line" indication is announced.

·         When reading: If reading the document by lines, sentences, or paragraphs and text wraps to a new line, the "new line" indication is announced. Note that if paragraph marks are not visible in the document, the "new line" indication may be heard twice when moving over paragraph marks.

·         During SayAll: If paragraph marks are visible in the document, they are heard both during SayAll and when reading; however, new lines within paragraphs are not indicated at all. If paragraph marks are not visible in the document, the "new line" indication is heard only where a paragraph mark exists. In this case, the new line indication may be heard twice to show that a double hard return is present.

·         Finally, you can combine any of these features using the following settings: When typing and navigating; When typing, navigating, and reading; When typing and reading; and When navigating and reading.

Tab Measurement Indication

When this option is on, JAWS states the new measurement from the left margin when the TAB key is pressed. the default is to announce the measurement.

Track Changes

This option controls if JAWS detects and announces any insertions, deletions, formatting changes, or comments made to a document using Word’s Track Changes feature.

Several choices are available for this option.

·         Off: JAWS does not detect any revisions.

·         Speak type: JAWS announces the type of revision made, for example, inserted text or deleted text. This is the default setting.

·         Speak type plus count: In addition to speaking the type of revision, JAWS also announces the number of revisions per line.

Note: You can also use CTRL+INSERT+R to announce revision information when the cursor is on a revised item. Refer to Track Changes for more information.

General Options Group

This group contains options that control overall JAWS behavior.

Document Presentation

This option controls how JAWS formats tables in documents. There are two modes, Simple and Screen Layout.

Simple Layout displays only the current cell, with special braille formatting in Structured mode to indicate the current table, row, and column numbers. As cells are navigated by any movement unit, including by line, only the current cell's content is spoken and displayed in braille.

Screen Layout is line-by-line format, much as you might see in a braille book. Columns in a table follow each other in linear format. This is the way table text appears on screen. A line contains an entire row, rather than a single cell. Cell padding, or borders, are indicated with a | (vertical bar or pipe) symbol. As table cells are navigated by line, entire rows of text are spoken and displayed in braille. As table cells are navigated by other movement units, only the current relevant information is spoken but the entire current row is still displayed in braille.

The default setting is Simple Layout. This means that only the current cell is spoken and displayed in braille.

Reading Options Group

This group contains options that control how JAWS behaves when reading and navigating text.

Bookmark Indication

This option controls whether to detect bookmarks while reading through the document. On means that bookmarks are announced and shown in braille as the document is navigated by character or word. On With Text means that when the bookmark is detected while navigating the document by character or word, the Text of the bookmark itself is also announced. The default setting is Off.

Border Changes

This option controls whether to detect changes in borders while reading the document. The default is off.

Comments, Footnotes, and Endnotes Detection

As you read or navigate through a Word document, JAWS can announce when it encounters a comment, footnote, or endnote. This detection is turned on by default. The following choices are available for this option:

·         On: Comments, footnotes, and endnotes are detected as the document is navigated.

·         Off: No comments, footnotes, and endnotes are detected.

·         On + Count: The number of Comments, footnotes, and endnotes on the current line is detected as the document is navigated by line.

·         On with Text: JAWS announces the text of comments, footnotes, and endnotes when the item is detected as the document is navigated by line.

If a braille display is attached, the footnote or endnote reference along with its text appears in braille to the left of its number. For a comment, the text of the comment appears along with its reference.

While navigating by line, you will hear the comment along with any associated replies. Navigating by character or word only indicates there is a comment.

It is important to note, however, that a comment, footnote, or endnote are not actually located at the place where their references appear in the document. To edit or review the text of such references, use the appropriate tabs on the Office ribbon. For example, to view footnotes or endnotes, press ALT+S for the Refferences tab and select "Show notes." For comments, press ALT+CTRL+M to activate the Comment pane.

To return to document reading from footnotes or endnotes view, press ALT+S for the Refferences tab and select "Show notes" again. From the Comment pane, press ESC.

The following keystrokes for reading comments, footnotes, and endnotes are also available:

·         CTRL+SHIFT+APOSTROPHE: Display a list of comments that appear in the document including any associated replies. To indicate a reply comment, JAWS announces "reply" using speech and braille before the comment text.

·         ALT+SHIFT+APOSTROPHE: Reread the comment referenced at the cursor.

·         ALT+SHIFT+E: Reread the referenced endnote or footnote.

·         INSERT+SHIFT+E: Lists all endnotes in the document.

·         INSERT+SHIFT+F: Lists all footnotes in the document.

·         WINDOWS Key+SEMICOLON: View a list of comments, endnotes, or footnotes in a Virtual Viewer window. The list of comments will include any associated replies. To indicate a reply comment, JAWS announces "reply" using speech and braille before the comment text.

Item Counts

As you navigate through a document, either by line, sentence, or paragraph, JAWS announces the number of errors and/or references according to the verbosity settings you have selected. Use this setting to specify whether the number of errors/references are announced before or after speaking text. The default is to speak them before text.

This setting affects:

·         Spelling and Grammar errors

·         Comment, Footnote, and Endnote references

·         Fields

·         Track changes revisions

Line Spacing Detection

This option lets JAWS announce in speech and braille any line spacing changes in the document. Single line spacing is the default in Word; however, a document can be double-spaced, triple-spaced, even set to fractional line spacing. To hear when such changes occur in a document, turn on this option. The default setting is Off.

Include Blank Paragraphs for Paragraph Navigation

This option controls whether navigation by CTRL+UP ARROW and CTRL+DOWN ARROW includes blank paragraphs. When enabled, navigation in the Word document using CTRL+UP ARROW and CTRL+DOWN ARROW will include blank lines as well as paragraphs with text. The default setting is Off which means that blank lines are skipped.

List Nesting Level Announcement

This option controls whether to announce the different levels of a multilevel, or nested, list as the document is navigated. The default is off.

Navigation Quick Keys

Use this option to toggle Navigation Quick Keys on or off in Microsoft Word. The default setting is Off when using Word. (Note that On is the default setting for any application where the Virtual Cursor is active, such as Internet Explorer.) You can also press INSERT+Z to quickly toggle Navigation Quick Keys on or off.

Object Count Detection

This option determines if JAWS detects and announces the number of embedded objects in the current document. The default setting is On. When enabled, as a document opens, or if you add an object from the Insert tab, JAWS announces the number of objects in the document.

Nonbreaking Symbols Indication

This option controls whether JAWS detects non-breaking symbols while navigating a document. When turned off, all non-breaking symbols are treated as their standard counterparts: for example, non-breaking spaces as spaces, non-breaking hyphens as hyphens, and so on. You can navigate a document using the following:

·         Characters

·         Characters and words

·         Characters, words, lines, sentences, and paragraphs

·         During Say All

Note: Pressing the Say Current Character (NUM PAD 5) keystroke three times quickly always indicates the symbol's true value even when the feature is turned off. The default setting is Characters. This means that when navigating only by character, the non-breaking symbols are detected.

Page, Section, and Multiple Column Breaks

JAWS automatically states your new tab position in the correct unit of measure, and also announces when you cross page boundaries. As you press TAB, JAWS tells you the distance from the left edge of the page to your new cursor position. When you press UP ARROW, DOWN ARRROW, PAGE UP, or PAGE DOWN and cross page boundaries, JAWS tells you the page number of the new page. JAWS also announces when you enter a section of a document that is in multiple columns.

Braille Options Group

This group contains options and groups of options that control what is shown on your braille display while navigating Word documents.

Braille Bullet Type Indication

This option controls whether JAWS detects bullets in braille with a single-cell indicator - the asterisk (*), or with multi-cell abbreviations that represent different bullet types. The default is on, which means that the multi-cell bullet indicator is displayed in braille for bullets.

Mark proofreading indication in braille

This option controls whether to show braille proofreading marks for spelling errors only, grammatical errors only, both, or neither. The default is to not show braille marking for spelling or grammatical errors.

Table Options Group

This group contains options that control table presentation on your braille display.

Table Number Display

Select this option to display table numbers in braille. It is independent of whether or not cell coordinates display in braille. When the option is selected, table numbers display as "tbl" followed by the number of the table where the cursor is located. When the option is off, only "tbl" displays to indicate that the cursor is within a table. This setting is on by default.

Document-Specific Settings Group

This group contains categories of settings which are saved on a document-specific basis.

Tables Group

This group of options controls how JAWS behaves when reading and navigating tables. For more detailed information on using the options in this group, refer to Tables in Word.

Defined Bookmark Table Column and Row Titles Override

This option controls whether to override detection of any named (bookmarked) table titles contained in the current document. The default is off, which means that JAWS detects document named table titles and ignores any table titles that you manually assign in a settings file. The other options are:

·         On for all files: JAWS overrides detection of any document named table titles that may exist in any document. None are read unless the user manually sets them and saves them in a settings file.

·         On for the current file: JAWS overrides any document named titles that may exist in the current document, but does detect them in other documents.

Table Titles Announce

This option controls whether JAWS detects row and column titles while reading table cells in the document. If the option for overriding defined bookmark table titles is turned off, the default setting is to Announce Only Marked Headers. This means that JAWS detects only the defined bookmarked headers in each table. You cannot manually change the setting.

Column Titles Row Set and Row Titles Column Set

These document-specific options allow you to manually define the currently selected cell or group of cells as a title row or title column.

In order to use this feature, you first need to change the default setting for "Defined Bookmark Table Column and Row Titles Override". That setting is off by default. This means that JAWS honors named titles for columns and rows already present in the document itself, if such bookmark named titles exist. The bookmark named titles must be of a certain form for JAWS to recognize them. For example, for Table 1 row and column titles, the bookmark name would be, "Title1". For only column titles, it would be, "ColumnTitle1", and for only row titles, it would be, "RowTitle1".

To set the current title row(s) or column(s) manually, first move up to the Defined Table Bookmark Titles Override option in the tree view. Then, press SPACEBAR to toggle the override setting to either "On for all files" or "On for the current file".

Now, move back down the list to define the current title row(s) or column(s) and press SpaceBar. Press ENTER to save the setting changes you have made. To learn more about how to use Defined Bookmark Table Column and Row Titles, see the topic, Tables in Word.

Title Definitions Clear

This option allows you to clear all table row and column definitions explicitly set. It has no effect on document named bookmark table headers.

Saving Word Options

After making a change to Word options, activate the OK button, or press ENTER, to save the changes and exit Quick Settings. JAWS remembers your settings for all Microsoft Word settings across sessions. For example, if you turn on proof reading information and exit Word, the next time you open Word, proof reading information is still enabled.

These application settings are saved in the word.jsi (JAWS Script Initialization) file, and are stored in the script directory. JAWS also remembers document specific settings each time you open a document for which specific settings have been saved. Document specific settings include Table Reading Definitions.

Note: The filename for document specific settings is called word_documentname.jsi, where documentname is the name of the document to which the settings apply. Each table’s definitions are stored in a section derived from the table number. When you choose Clear Definitions from the Quick Settings dialog box, the current table’s settings are deleted from the .jsi file.

Tip: Turn off all Word specific Quick Settings options to make Word more responsive.

Winamp Helpful Hints

Winamp provides a Playlist Editor, which allows you to manage the number of tracks to be played, and an Equalizer, which allows you to adjust the sound quality. When you open Winamp, you are in a main window where you can open an audio clip, start and stop playing, view track information, and so on. The Playlist Editor and Equalizer reside in windows within Winamp. The toggle keys listed in JAWS commands for Winamp open and close these windows. When using the toggle commands to open these windows, JAWS does not move to the newly opened window. To move to the new window, press CTRL+TAB until you reach the new window. If you use a toggle command to close the current window, JAWS changes to the next open window. For a list of open windows and to find out which one is current, press INSERT+SHIFT+W.

Note: Always use the Winamp Classic skin when running Winamp.
 In version 5.3, press F6 to toggle between different dialog panes in the Winamp Library.

The Windows Clipboard

The Windows clipboard is where selected text or graphics are placed when you press CTRL+C to copy, or CTRL+X to cut. Think of the clipboard as a holding bin for information that will eventually be pasted to another location. Each time you copy or cut an item, the contents of the Windows clipboard are overwritten, so that only the last item that was copied or cut can be pasted. You can read the contents of the clipboard at anytime by pressing WINDOWS Key+INSERT+X.

 

  ------ --- ------
  Back       Next
  ------ --- ------

The Office Clipboard

The Office Clipboard allows you to copy or cut up to 12 different selections. You can then paste them individually or all at once. You can also paste the selections in a different order from that which they were copied or cut. You should note that when you copy or cut items to the Office Clipboard, only the last item is copied to the Windows clipboard. Therefore, if you paste outside of an Office application, you will only paste what was copied or cut last. Also if you copy or cut more than the permitted 12 selections to the Office Clipboard, you will be asked whether the first item should be removed, or whether the current item should not be copied.

 

 

  ------ --- ------
  Back       Next
  ------ --- ------

The Office Clipboard Toolbar

Copying or cutting more than one item activates the Office Clipboard, and it appears on the screen as a small floating toolbar. This toolbar will remain visible in all programs included in Office 2000 and later. It is recommended that the first time you encounter the Office Clipboard that you dock the toolbar.

 

 

  ------ --- ------
  Back       Next
  ------ --- ------

Dock the Office Clipboard Toolbar

To dock the Office clipboard toolbar, use the JAWS cursor to navigate to the title bar of the floating toolbar. You will hear JAWS say or spell, "Clipboard." When the JAWS cursor is around the letter I in the word clipboard, press NUM PAD SLASH twice in rapid succession to simulate a left mouse double click. The Office Clipboard toolbar will be docked under the menu bar, and you will be able to access it like any other toolbar.

 

 

  ------ --- ------

What's Available on the Office Clipboard Toolbar

The buttons on the Office Clipboard toolbar are:

·         Copy

·         Paste All

·         Items, which has a submenu of the item in the clipboard.

·         Clear Clipboard, which also clears the Windows clipboard.

Turning Off the Office Clipboard

Select toolbars from the View menu, and then press the DOWN ARROW key to move to clipboard. Press ENTER to uncheck the clipboard toolbar and exit the menu.

  Back       Next
  ------ --- ------

Office Clipboard Helpful Hints

You cannot customize the Office Clipboard toolbar.

When you clear the Office Clipboard, the Windows Clipboard is also cleared.

You must go into each Office 2000 application one at a time to turn off the Office Clipboard if you do not want it running in that particular application.

In Outlook 2000 and later, you cannot access the Clipboard choice from the main window. You have to access it once you are in an open message.

WordPerfect Helpful Hints

Navigation Quick Keys

Navigation Quick Keys for WordPerfect 12 and later provide you with an easy and efficient way to move through a document. You can quickly move the insertion point to a number of different page elements, including headings, tables, form fields, pages, and more, with a single keystroke. Navigation Quick Keys are automatically enabled while you are reading with the Say All command. If you want to use this feature when not performing the Say All command, do the following:

1.    In WordPerfect, press INSERT+V, select "Navigation Quick Keys," and press the SPACEBAR to choose "Quick Keys On." Alternatively, you can press INSERT+Z.

2.    Use the keystrokes in the WordPerfect Navigation Quick Keys table to move the insertion point to the next or previous element of the given type.
 
 While Navigation Quick Keys are enabled, you cannot type text into the document. In addition, you can only use the TAB key to move to the next form field or table cell. To determine if Navigation Quick Keys are enabled, press ALT+DELETE.

3.    To turn off Navigation Quick Keys again, press ENTER. JAWS also turns off Navigation Quick Keys if you switch to another document or program.

Using Navigation Quick Keys During Say All

When you use the Say All command (INSERT+DOWN ARROW), Navigation Quick Keys are automatically enabled while JAWS is reading. You can use the Navigation Quick Keys to skip ahead or move backward through the document by heading, page, form field, bookmark, and so on. You can press CTRL to stop speech normally. Alternatively, you can press ENTER to stop the Say All and turn on Navigation Quick Keys.

WordPerfect Navigation Quick Keys

Tip: You can use the SHIFT key in combination with most of the keystrokes in the table below to move to the previous element of that type in the document.

Tables

Special JAWS keystrokes allow you to easily read tables. For more information see Using JAWS to Navigate Tables.

Screen Sensitive Help

Screen Sensitive Help provides status on the following WordPerfect characteristics:

·         If you are in the main documents window

·         If the document is read-only

·         If you are in a table, Screen Sensitive Help also gives the coordinates and name of the table

·         If Reveal Codes are active

·         If Type Over Mode is active

·         If Block Mode is active

·         If the document contains multiple text columns (such as newspaper style columns)

Position Information

Position Information is a verbosity preference item. It can be set in Settings Center using Configure Verbosity Levels in the Speech Verbosity group. At the Advanced level it is typically turned off. For WordPerfect this setting is turned on. Position Information is useful when working in tables. It identifies when the cursor moves to a new row or column. To turn this feature off, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center while working in WordPerfect and expand the Speech Verbosity group.

2.    Select and expand the Configure Verbosity Levels group, and then select the appropriate verbosity level.

3.    In the Preferences dialog box, clear the Position Information check box.

4.    Close the dialog box, and save the change in Settings Center.

Verbosity Options

The following Verbosity items are off by default to minimize the amount that JAWS speaks initially. When a user needs to hear more information about the selected text, these features may be toggled on using Quick Settings (INSERT+V).

Page and Column Detection

Style Detection

Table Detection

Language Detection

Border Detection

Page And Column Detection

This feature provides automatic detection and announcement of document page breaks and column breaks. When Page or Column Break Detection is ON, you hear information about new pages as you navigate from page to page within your document. Also, if the document contains multiple text columns, such as newspaper style columns, JAWS will announce the text column and the number of columns, (for example, text column 1 of 2) and the column type (for example: NewsPaper).

Style Detection

This feature provides automatic detection and announcement of document style changes. When Style Detection is On, JAWS announces any new text styles it encounters as the cursor moves through text. Table Style detection has also been included. Before table Style detection will work, Table detection has to be turned on. Style detection is turned OFF by default.

Table Detection

This feature provides detection and announcement of tables, row and column focus, end and beginning of rows and columns. You will also be notified if a cell contains a formula, the size of the table in columns and rows, and the name of the Table.

Language Detection

When Language Detection and Automatic Language Switching are ON and you are using Eloquence, as the cursor moves into a language supported by Eloquence, the synthesizer automatically changes languages. If the synthesizer in use is not Eloquence, or if Eloquence does not support the detected language, JAWS only announces the language name in the message voice.

SayLine, SaySentence and SayParagraph honor language detection. If a language change is detected during speech, JAWS either switches languages or announce the detected language while speaking the current line, sentence, or paragraph. This feature is turned OFF by default.

You must ensure that all foreign language dictionaries are installed prior to enabling the Language Detection feature to avoid having the Install On Demand dialogs appear while navigating, which could potentially cause JAWS to lose speech.

Border Detection

This feature detects and describes text borders. When Border Detection is ON, JAWS will tell you whenever the cursor enters an area with a border, and if possible, give a description of that border. This feature is turned OFF by default.

WordPerfect 10 and Later Considerations

JAWS automatically turns off the PowerBar when you start WordPerfect 10 and later to ensure documents are read correctly. Several JAWS commands require the PowerBar. For these commands, JAWS turns the PowerBar on and closes it again after the command has completed. The commands are:

·         Open Font combo box, CTRL+SHIFT+F

·         Point Size combo box, CTRL+SHIFT+P

·         Style combo Box, CTRL+SHIFT+S

·         Proofing tools as you go, CTRL+SHIFT+M - These include Spell checking, Grammar checking, and Thesaurus.

For WordPerfect 10 and later, JAWS graphics verbosity is set to labeled graphics. If you change this to all graphics, this may result in extra information being spoken when you move to a blank line. This may also occur in WordPerfect 9.

Command Descriptions for HTML

General

Marking and Returning to a PlaceMarker in Word

Word uses bookmarks to let you mark and later find locations in a document. However, this also means that you are editing and changing the document. When using the PlaceMarker feature while in a Word document, you can mark a location without affecting the document. It allows you to easily return to the PlaceMarker any time, even after closing Word or rebooting your computer. There is no need to remember that location or use Navigation Quick Keys or a dialog to find it, as you would a bookmark.

You can also use this feature to select all text between the PlaceMarker location and any other position in the document simply by moving to it and issuing a JAWS command. This lets you select chunks of text not only by line, sentence, or paragraph, but any portion of text in the document, even several pages. Once it is selected, you can do all the typical things you would normally do with selected text.

Setting and Returning to a PlaceMarker in Word

Press CTRL+WINDOWS Key+K to set a marker at the current cursor position. JAWS announces the message, "Marking place." If there is already a marker at this location, JAWS announces, "Place already marked."

Press ALT+WINDOWS Key+K to return to the marker. JAWS announces, "Returning to marked place."

The marker is saved to a JSI file called Word_MarkedPlaceDocuments.jsi, which can be found in the Personalized Settings folder.

Note: You cannot assign a PlaceMarker at the beginning or end of a document. If you are trying to move to the top of the first page or bottom of the last page, press CTRL+HOME or CTRL+END.

Selecting Text from the PlaceMarker to the Cursor

Press INSERT+SPACEBAR, M to select text or items from the marker to the current cursor position.

Note: This is a layered keystroke, which means that you press and release INSERT+SPACEBAR, and then press M.

To clear the join setup process, press CTRL+INSERT+C after the first press of CTRL+SHIFT+J. This function only works in the Query Design View grid and is subject to the normal Access constraints. These keystrokes are only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Create Relationship – Use CTRL+SHIFT+C to create a relationship between the source and destination fields and tables. This is accomplished by pressing the keystroke once on the Source field in the Source table, and then again on the Destination field. To clear the relationship setup process, press CTRL+INSERT+C after the first press of CTRL+SHIFT+C . This function only works in the Relationships screen accessed from the Tools menu and is subject to the normal Access constraints. These keystrokes are only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Delete Relationship – Use CTRL+DELETE to delete a relationship between the source and destination. When in the Relationships screen, focus on the list box and the participating item of the relationship, and then press CTRL+DELETE to delete. You can confirm whether a field participates in a relationship by using the INSERT+UP ARROW (Say Line) keystroke. These keystrokes are only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Note:  Caution should be used when deleting relationships. Using this keystroke will delete the first relationship in which the field participates. This means that if the field participates in more than one relationship and you intend to delete the second relationship, it is better to move to the other table and the field in that table which forms the other half of the second relationship (providing this field in the second table only participates in one relationship) and delete the relationship from this table. If the field making up the other half of the relationship also participates in more than one relationship, sighted assistance may be required unless you delete the first relationship, then the second, and then recreate the first.

Read Active Report – Use CTRL+SHIFT+R to read the active report. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Read DataSheet Coordinates – Use INSERT+C when in a datasheet, this keystroke reads the location row and column number.

Relationship and Join Clear Values – Use CTRL+INSERT+C clears the JAWS stored value for the source of a join or relationship. This is similar to frame Clear Values in Default. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Say Record Number – Use CTRL+INSERT+R to hear the record number of the currently selected record in datasheet table view.

Screen Sensitive Help – Use INSERT+F1 for help in most areas, including the wizard and design view screens. This keystroke will also give you valuable information about the field you are in when entering data into a table. The information includes the field name, data type, size in characters, ordinal position, total number of fields, and whether data in this field is required or optional. In verbosity levels higher than Beginner, this information is trimmed down, but still includes important information.

Select Form Control – Use CTRL+SHIFT+L to list all of the controls on the current form. You can also use this keystroke to select and focus on a control (provided the control can receive focus). If you select a sub-form control, then another list opens where you can select a sub-form control. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003.

Select Toolbox Control – Use CTRL+SHIFT+B to select a toolbox control to place on a form or report in design view. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Speak Database Summary – Use CTRL+SHIFT+D to speak a summary of the open database, including the name and number of objects. Objects include tables, queries, modules, relationships, forms, and so on. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003.

Speak Relationship – Use INSERT+UP ARROW (Say Line) to speak details about a relationship. This keystroke only works in the Relationships screen that is accessed from the Tools menu. For example, you can use this keystroke in the Relationships screen of the Northwind database that comes with Microsoft Access to provide the location of fields. For instance, if you press INSERT+UP ARROW when the Supplier ID field is selected in the supplier table, JAWS tells you that the Products table references this field. Similarly, if you press INSERT+UP ARROW when the Product ID field in the Products table is selected, JAWS tells you that the Order Details table references the Product ID. Pressing INSERT+UP ARROW when the product ID field is selected in the Order Details table causes JAWS to say that Product ID references the Product table. So, JAWS tells you both when a field references another table and when another table references it. If the verbosity is set to anything higher than Beginner, a trimmed down version of the same information is spoken, for example, the table name containing the selected field is left out – it is assumed that it is already known.

Speak Table Summary – Use CTRL+SHIFT+T to hear a summary of the table currently displayed, including the name, data type, size, and total number of fields. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003.

Spell Check – Use INSERT+F7 to repeat spell checker information.

Toggle Label Search – Use INSERT+F8 to toggle Label Search on or off. This keystroke is only available in Access 2003. Press the APPLICATIONS key to use the Context menu for later versions.

Say Access Version – Use CTRL+INSERT+V to hear what version of Access is currently running.

Excel Row and Column Title Reading

Defining Row and Column Titles

Before JAWS can read the titles of cells within a spreadsheet, you must specify which columns and/or rows contain those titles. To define row titles, move to the column containing the row titles and press INSERT+CTRL+ALT+R. To define column titles, move to the row containing the column titles and press INSERT+CTRL+ALT+C.

Tip: You can also press INSERT+V to use Quick Settings to define row and column titles.

Alternatively, you can use Excel's naming function to specify which rows and columns contain cell titles. Using names instead of JAWS commands makes the spreadsheet accessible to any user of JAWS. There is no need to provide other users with the spreadsheet's .jsi file because the row and column title information is saved in the worksheet. This feature allows any spreadsheet author to define row and column titles without installing or using JAWS.

To use names to define row and column titles, do the following:

1.    Move to the first cell in the column or row containing the titles. If the spreadsheet contains both row and column titles, move to the cell where these two intersect.

2.    For Excel 2007 or later, do the following:
 From the Formulas tab, choose Name Manager in the Define Names group. The Name Manager dialog box opens.
 Next, choose New. The New Name dialog box opens with focus in the Name edit field.
 
 For Excel 2003, do the following:
 From the Insert menu, select Name and press RIGHT ARROW.
 Select Define and press ENTER.

3.    If the column contains row titles, type "RowTitle" and press ENTER. If the row contains column titles, type "ColumnTitle" and press ENTER. If the cell is the intersection of both row and column titles, type "Title" and press ENTER.
 
 If you are defining column/row titles for any worksheet other than worksheet 1, you must add the number of the worksheet after "RowTitle," "ColumnTitle," or "Title." For example, if you are defining a row containing column titles in worksheet 4, you would type "ColumnTitle4." To hear which worksheet you are in, press INSERT+F1.

Tip: You can define more than one row or column as a title range. For example, if you want to define rows 1 and 2 as column titles, select both rows and then assign the name "ColumnTitle" to them.

JAWS can now recognize the cell as the beginning of a range of row and/or column titles. If a particular worksheet within a workbook has title rows and/or columns defined using this feature, you cannot use the standard JAWS method for defining title rows and/or columns. However, if another worksheet in the same workbook does not have row and column titles defined using the Excel naming function, you can use the standard JAWS method.

Overriding Named Titles

Any JAWS user can override row and column title information provided by the spreadsheet author. To do this, press INSERT+V while you are in Excel to open Quick Settings. Select "Define Name Column and Row Titles Override" and use the SPACEBAR to cycle through the available options. Choose "On for the current file" to override named titles only in the currently open spreadsheet. Choose "On for all files" to override named titles in all spreadsheets that you open in Excel. If you want to use the row and column title information provided by the author again, choose "Off."

Defining Row and Column Titles for Worksheets with Multiple Regions

You can define individual row and/or column titles for different regions in the same workbook. To define a row and/or column title for region, you use the same procedure described in Defining Row and Column Titles to assign a specific name to a cell in the heading row and/or column. However, you must use the following procedure when defining names for row and column titles that are specific to one region:

1.    Position the cursor on the cell that will be used as the beginning of the region (for example, "A1"). This is the top left cell of the region.

2.    Type "Title," "RowTitle," or "ColumnTitle" depending on whether this cell is in the heading row, heading column, or both.

3.    Since Excel requires that every named range be unique, it is recommended you add another identifier after the title. The simplest approach would be to add the sheet number. For example, you would type a "1" if the cells were in the first worksheet. There should be no space between the previous text and this number.

4.    Type two periods followed by the coordinates of the bottom right cell in the region (for example, "N9").

For example, assume you have a spreadsheet with a region whose boundaries are row 1 at column A and row 9 at column N. It also has a second region with boundaries of row 10 at column C and row 14 at column D. Both regions are on worksheet 1. To define row 1 as the row containing column headers for the cells in the first region, you would assign the following name to cell A1:
 “ColumnTitle1..N9”
 To define row 10 as the row containing column headers for the cells in the second region, you would assign the following name to cell C10:
 “ColumnTitle1..D14”

Changing Title Reading Options

You can change how JAWS reads row and column titles you have defined in the Excel options. Press INSERT+V, and then press T to move to the "Title Reading Detection" option in the Title Reading group. Next, press the SPACEBAR to choose one of the following:

·         Off - JAWS does not announce row or column titles.

·         Read Row Titles - When you move to a different row, JAWS reads the row title. JAWS does not announce column titles.

·         Read Column Titles - When you move to a different column, JAWS reads the column title. JAWS does not announce row titles.

·         Read Both Titles - When you move to a different column, JAWS reads the column title. When you move to a different row, JAWS reads the row title.

Reading Columns and Rows Containing Totals

You can indicate which columns and/or rows contain the total of values in other cells. If the spreadsheet calculates column totals, move to the row containing these totals and press CTRL+INSERT+DELETE. If the spreadsheet calculates row totals, move to the column containing these totals and press CTRL+INSERT+ENTER.

Tip: You can also press INSERT+V to use Quick Settings to specify which row and column contains totals.

After you have defined the row that contains column totals, you can press INSERT+DELETE to hear the total for the current column. Similarly, after you have defined the column that contains row totals, you can press INSERT+ENTER to hear the total for the current row.

JAWS only reads the value displayed in the totals row/column and does not automatically perform the necessary calculations. You must use Excel to insert a formula that will calculate the total of a given range of cells. For more information on using formulas, refer to Miscellaneous Excel Hints.

Reading Visible Rows and Columns of a Spreadsheet

JAWS provides keystrokes to read only the portion of the spreadsheet that is visible on the screen. If Title reading is enabled, pressing these keystrokes reads the appropriate title cells followed by the visible cells' contents.

  --------------------------------------- ----------------------
  Description                             Keystroke
  Read visible row                        INSERT+UP ARROW
  Read visible row to current cell        INSERT+HOME
  Read visible row from current cell      INSERT+PAGE UP
  Read visible column                     INSERT+CTRL+UP ARROW
  Read visible column to current cell     INSERT+CTRL+HOME
  Read visible column from current cell   INSERT+CTRL+PAGE UP
  --------------------------------------- ----------------------

Using One Settings File for Similar Spreadsheets with Different File Names

When you define settings like row and column titles and totals, you may want these settings to be available for other versions of the spreadsheet that have different names. For example, suppose that you define row and column totals for a spreadsheet named Sales1.xls. This spreadsheet is updated each month, and the name is changed accordingly. Therefore, next month's spreadsheet will be named Sales2.xls and so on. However, by default, JAWS only loads settings (.jsi) files for spreadsheets with the same file name. JAWS will not use settings you defined for Sales1.xls for Sales2.xls.

However, JAWS provides a feature that allows you to apply an existing settings file to a spreadsheet with a different name that is similar in design. To use this feature, open the spreadsheet in Excel, press INSERT+V, select the option "Workbook Settings," and press the SPACEBAR to choose "Best Match." JAWS searches for the closest matching settings file available and applies it to the current workbook. In the previous example, the spreadsheet Sales2.xls would use the settings file you created for Sales1.xls (excel_Sales1.xls.jsi). This feature makes it easy to apply your verbosity settings to subsequent versions of a spreadsheet without creating new a file each time the name changes.

Monitor Cells in Excel

Ten monitor cells can be set per worksheet. These cells are retained as you move in and out of the worksheet. You can use keystrokes or Quick Settings to set and read monitor cells. You can also create monitor cells for individual cells or a range of cells in a worksheet.

Setting Monitor Cells

Do the following to assign a keystroke to a cell.

1.    Move to the cell in the worksheet that you want to assign a monitor keystroke to. Note that when assigning a monitor keystroke to a range of cells, always select the cell range first before assigning the keystroke.

2.    Use INSERT+SHIFT+1 through INSERT+SHIFT+0 to set the monitor cell for the selected worksheet cell. For example, if focus is in cell A1, you can make it monitor cell 1 by pressing INSERT+SHIFT+1. Likewise, you can make it monitor cell 2 by pressing INSERT+SHIFT+2, and so on.

Note: If a monitor cell was previously set and you then try to set that cell again, JAWS announces that you are about to overwrite the existing monitor cell. You can cancel or continue and overwrite the monitor cell.

Do the following to assign a monitor cell using Quick Settings.

1.    Move to the cell in the worksheet that you want to assign as a monitor cell. Note that when assigning a monitor keystroke to a range of cells, always select the cell range first before assigning the keystroke.

2.    Press INSERT+V to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.

3.    Type "monitor" without the quotes. Results are filtered in the Quick Settings tree view.

4.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to the Monitoring Cells group in the Workbook, Worksheet, and Region Settings group.

5.    Press DOWN ARROW again to step through the 10 different monitor cells labeled Monitor Cell 1 to Monitor Cell 10.

6.    Select the monitor cell option that you want to assign to the current cell, and then press SPACEBAR. Note that monitor cell values are Unassigned; or the coordinates for an individual cell (for example, Assigned to A1); or the cell range (for example, Assigned to B1:B7) at the current cursor location.

7.    Press TAB to move to the OK button and then press SPACEBAR to save the change and exit Quick Settings.

Note: If a monitor cell was previously set and you then try to set that cell again, JAWS announces that the monitor cell is already assigned to a cell, and will be reassigned to a new cell.

Reading Monitor Cells

To read monitor cells use ALT+SHIFT+1 through ALT+SHIFT+0.

When reading monitor cells, JAWS also reads the cell’s coordinates, and, by default, the title of the cell. If you do not want the cell title announced, do the following.

1.    Press INSERT+V to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.

2.    Type "monitor cell titles read" without the quotes. Results are filtered in the Quick Settings tree view.

3.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to the Monitor Cell Titles Read option in the tree view.

4.    Press SPACEBAR to clear the check box.

5.    Press TAB to move to the OK button and then press SPACEBAR to save the change and exit Quick Settings.

Displaying Monitor Cells

To display a list of monitored cells, press CTRL+SHIFT+M. The coordinates and contents of each defined monitor cell are listed in a dialog box. If the monitor cell is a range, then the coordinates of the range display. You can choose to move to the monitor cell from this dialog box.

Clearing Monitor Cells

Do the following to clear a single monitor cell using Quick Settings.

1.    Press INSERT+V to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.

2.    Type "monitor" without the quotes. Results are filtered in the Quick Settings tree view.

3.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to the Monitoring Cells group in the Workbook, Worksheet, and Region Settings group.

4.    Press DOWN ARROW again until you reach the monitor cell that you want to clear. Monitor cells are labeled as Monitor Cell 1 through Monitor Cell 10.

5.    Press SPACEBAR to change the setting to Unassigned.

6.    Press TAB to move to the OK button and then press SPACEBAR to save the change and exit Quick Settings.

Do the following to clear all monitor cells using Quick Settings.

1.    Press INSERT+V to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.

2.    Type "monitor cells clear" without the quotes. Results are filtered in the Quick Settings tree view.

3.    Press DOWN ARROW to move to the Monitoring Cells Clear option.

4.    Press SPACEBAR to clear all monitor cells.

5.    Press TAB to move to the OK button and then press SPACEBAR to save the change and exit Quick Settings.

Return to Previous Cell from Monitor Cell

After you use CTRL+SHIFT+M to move to a monitor cell, you can now easily move back to your position immediately before you moved to the monitor cell with CTRL+SHIFT+GRÀVE.

Region Specific Excel Settings

Title and total reading can be set on a region-by-region basis, and JAWS automatically uses the settings as you move into the relevant region. JAWS also tells you when you move into a new region. Now you can have adjacent tables on the same worksheet.

By default, single region support is enabled. To enable multiple region support, press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings, move to Region, and press SPACEBAR to toggle the setting.

Note: When using single region support, the entire worksheet is treated as one region for title and total reading.

There are two ways to define a region:

·         Define a range of cells as a region

·         Use Excel's default definition of a region

Defining a Region

To define a region within Excel:

1.    Select the entire scope of the cells you want included in the region.

2.    Select Insert, Name, Define.

3.    Type in a name for the region and press ENTER.

The advantage to naming your own region is to include blank rows and columns. JAWS stores the region names in a *.jsi file.

Excel's Default Definition of a Region

By default, Excel defines a region as a group of contiguous cells containing data. The edges of the region are determined by a surrounding row and column of empty cells. This means a default Excel region cannot contain a row or column of blank cells.

JAWS looks only in the current region to calculate row or column totals. If you request a row or column total and there is an adjacent table, JAWS finds the accurate total.

Limitations of Multiple Region Support

Multiple region support is designed to enhance the functionality of row and column title reading as well as row and column total reading. It is not designed to support all JAWS Excel commands. Many JAWS Excel commands do not recognize multiple regions. Some of these commands are:

·         List Cells in Current Column (CTRL+SHIFT+C)

·         List Cells in Current Row (CTRL+SHIFT+R)

·         Lists cells at page break (CTRL+SHIFT+B)

·         List cells with comments (CTRL+SHIFT+APOSTROPHE)

·         List Visible cells with data (CTRL+SHIFT+D)

There are also a few other commands that do not apply to multiple region support as they do not list information from spreadsheet cells, such as the List Worksheets command (CTRL+SHIFT+S).

Creating a Custom Summary in Excel

The Custom Summary feature allows you to create a snapshot of important data from a worksheet, such as monthly totals, grand totals, and so on. You define which cells appear in the custom summary by assigning labels to them. The summary then displays the contents of all the specified cells. The summary contains links, allowing you to move quickly to any of the cells. If the worksheet's data changes after the custom summary is created, the same summary can be used to obtain the new information.

Tip: When the focus moves to a worksheet with a custom summary, JAWS indicates that a summary is available.

To create a custom summary, you must assign custom summary labels to each cell or range of cells that you want to include. Do the following to assign labels to cells in the current worksheet:

1.    Select the cell or range of cells that you want to include in the summary.

2.    Press INSERT+F2, select "Custom Summary Labels," and press ENTER. Alternatively, you can press CTRL+INSERT+TAB. The dialog box that appears allows you to add, change, delete, and reorder custom summary labels.

3.    Choose the Add button.

4.    Type the text you want to use for the label and press ENTER.

5.    If you want to change or delete any label you have created, select it in the list and choose either the Change or Remove button. If you want to delete all the labels you have created, choose the Remove All button. When you are satisfied with the name and position of the label, choose the OK button.

Tip: The order of the labels in the list determines the order in which they appear when you view the custom summary. To change the position of a label, select it from the list and then use the Move Up and Move Down buttons.

6.    Repeat steps 1 through 5 until you have labeled all cells that you want to include in the summary.

When you are finished assigning labels, you can view your custom summary.

Changing or Deleting a Custom Summary Label

To change or delete a custom summary label, select the cell or range of cells the label is assigned to and press CTRL+INSERT+TAB. To change the name of the label, choose the Change button. Then, type some new text for the custom label and press ENTER. To delete the label, choose the Remove button.

To remove all custom summary labels in the current worksheet, press INSERT+F2 while in any cell that does not have a custom summary label. Then, select "Custom Summary Labels" and choose Remove All.

Viewing the Custom Summary

Once you have assigned labels to all the cells you want to include in the summary, you are ready to view the custom summary. Press INSERT+F2, select "View Custom Summary," and press ENTER. The name of each cell that you labeled appears, along with its contents. Alternatively, you can press CTRL+INSERT+SHIFT+TAB to view the summary at any time. JAWS displays summary information for all worksheets that have custom summary labels assigned. Each item in the summary has a link that you can activate by pressing ENTER. Activating the link moves you to the location of that cell in the worksheet. If the label is assigned to a range of cells, JAWS moves you to the first cell in the range.

Tip: You can press INSERT+F7 while the custom summary is displayed to view a list of all links in the summary.

Saving JAWS Excel Settings

JAWS remembers your Verbosity settings for all Microsoft Excel specific Verbosity settings across sessions. Excel specific verbosity settings include: cell reading, selection reading, detect cell number format change, and detect cell border change.

 

Workbook Settings

Workbook Settings in Quick Settings contains three settings: Exact Match, Best Match, and New JSI File. Workbook Settings determine what settings to use to read a particular workbook. If you often receive workbooks that contain similar setups, for instance, if you receive a workbook every month for which you can use the same title, total, and monitor settings, you would not want to have to set these features for every new workbook. Now with JAWS Workbook Settings, if you choose Best Match, JAWS determines which of your settings files best matches the current workbook, and automatically loads these settings.

Note: If you change Verbosity settings while Best Match is selected, the changes are saved to the JSI file specified under Workbook Settings, Best Match.

If you only want settings to load if they are designed for a particular workbook, choose Exact Match.

If you need to modify Verbosity settings for a workbook that uses Best Match settings, but need to keep the specified JSI file unchanged for use with other files, select New JSI File, press ENTER to exit the Verbosity dialog, and then reopen the Verbosity dialog and make your changes. Workbook Settings will be set to Exact Match, with a JSI file specified for the current workbook.

Excel Braille Modes

Use the Braille Mode Verbosity option when you use Structured Mode for your Braille display. With the Braille Mode Verbosity option, you may choose between three different Structured Modes while navigating an Excel spreadsheet.

Cell View is the classical view, which shows the active cells' coordinates, column and row titles where appropriate, cell content, cell formula, cell comment, cell hyperlink address, row total, monitor cells, etc.

Row Mode shows up to 9 cells surrounding the active cell in the current row. Blank cells are shown with a minus (dots 3-6). The active cell is always the middle piece of data unless you are at the beginning or end of the row, where it is then the first or last piece of data shown. The coordinates of the active cell are always shown immediately before the active cell contents so it is easy to locate the focus on the display.

Column View shows up to 9 cells surrounding the active cell in the current column. The active cell is the middle piece of data, unless you are at the beginning or end of a column, and then the active cell is the first or last piece of data shown. Blank cells are indicated with a minus sign (dots 3-6). The coordinates of the active cell always precede the active cell so it is easy to locate the focus on the display.

Note: When you press F2 to edit a cell's contents, Line Mode is activated, so the caret is tracked while you edit.

Miscellaneous Excel Hints

·         The JAWS keystroke INSERT+F identifies four kinds of underline styles instead of just stating if underlining is on or off.

·         INSERT+5 and INSERT+F (when the color has been changed from the default) correctly identify the cell’s text color, background color, and shading.

·         JAWS automatically selects a file listed in the Open or Save As list views when JAWS is set at Beginner Verbosity.

·         Screen Sensitive Help in the worksheet states the number of worksheets in the current workbook. CTRL+PAGE UP or CTRL+PAGE DOWN and CTRL+SHIFT+S can be used to move between other sheets.

Cell Appearance Information

You can now press INSERT+TAB twice while in a cell to display detailed information regarding the visual appearance of that cell in the virtual viewer. JAWS displays the width of the column, whether the text is entirely visible, the height of the cell if greater than one line, whether the text has been shrunk or rotated, the cell's vertical and horizontal alignment, font information, the presence of any inverted negative numbers and their color, the indentation level, the number format,and cell shading and text color information.

Announcing Cell Shading Changes

If a cell's shading is different from the cell you just moved out of, JAWS can announce the change along with all other cell information. To enable this feature, do the following:

1.    In Excel, press INSERT+V.

2.    Select "Shading Changes."

3.    Press the SPACEBAR to choose "On."

4.    Press ENTER to close the dialog box.

Cell Visibility

JAWS can inform you when data in the current cell is only partially visible. This usually occurs because the cell is too small to contain all the data. To enable this feature, do the following:

1.    In Excel, press INSERT+V.

2.    Select "Cell Text Visibility."

3.    Press the SPACEBAR to choose "On."

4.    Press ENTER to close the dialog box.

Now, whenever you navigate to a cell containing partially visible data, JAWS will inform you which cells are overlapped by the text. You can repeat this information by pressing INSERT+TAB. This option remains enabled until you change it again or quit JAWS.

Creating Formulas

When you create a formula in Excel, you can navigate to and select a cell or range of cells in another workbook or worksheet in order to use that data as part of the formula. When you create a formula this way, JAWS makes it easier to navigate to the cells containing the data you want to include by announcing the name of the active worksheet/workbook.

To begin creating a formula, type an equal sign (=) in a cell. Then, switch to the worksheet/workbook containing the data you want to use in your formula. Select the cell or range of cells you want to reference and press ENTER. If necessary, you can press CTRL+NUM PAD 5 to hear the coordinates of the last cell you navigated to. Excel creates the formula and the focus returns to the cell (and workbook/worksheet) containing the new formula.

At any time, you can press INSERT+TAB or INSERT+C to hear the name and worksheet of the cell where the formula is being created. Similarly, you can use the Say Line command (INSERT+UP ARROW) at any time to read the formula. If you want a list of cells that contain formulas, press INSERT+SHIFT+F. If you want to cancel the formula and return to that cell in the workbook/worksheet, press ESC.

Creating Comments

Comments can be used to provide additional information about the data in a particular cell. To create a comment, navigate to the cell where you want to add a comment and press SHIFT+F2. Type the text of the comment into the edit field and then press ENTER.

To modify an existing comment, navigate to the cell containing the comment and press SHIFT+F2. The edit field will contain the original comment text. Make the necessary changes and then press ENTER.

As you navigate, JAWS will announce if a cell contains a comment. To read the comment for the current cell, press ALT+SHIFT+APOSTROPHE. To list all cells with comments, press CTRL+SHIFT+APOSTROPHE.

Toggling Announcement of Formulas and Comments

The announcement of formulas and comments can be toggled for each worksheet in a specific workbook. There are two verbosity options for this feature. Both formula and comment announcement are on by default. They can be toggled individually on or off through Quick Settings. For example, formula announcement can be on while comments are off in worksheet 1, while the reverse is true in worksheet 2.

Beginner Verbosity

When you navigate a spreadsheet at the Beginner verbosity level, JAWS announces "has comment" if a cell has an attached comment, "has formula" if a cell contains a formula, and "has hyperlink" if the cell has an associated hyperlink.

Maximum Number of Rows

The maximum number of rows in a column is 65536, but JAWS only looks at the first 256 when listing cells with data in the current column (INSERT+SHIFT+C) If you would like JAWS to search more rows for data, change the maximum allowable rows to search by reassigning the constant called MaxRowsToSearch in the excel.jsh file. Please note that this constant cannot be more than the maximum allowable integer value permitted by JAWS script language.

Position Information

Position Information is a verbosity preference item. It can be set in Settings Center using Configure Verbosity Levels in the Speech Verbosity group. At the Advanced level it is typically turned off. For Excel this setting is turned on. Position Information is useful when working in tables. It identifies when the cursor moves to a new row or column. To turn this feature off, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center while working in Excel and expand the Speech Verbosity group.

2.    Select and expand the Configure Verbosity Levels group, and then select the appropriate verbosity level.

3.    In the Preferences dialog box, clear the Position Information check box.

4.    Close the dialog box, and save the change in Settings Center.

Merged Cells

In Excel, you can merge two or more cells into a single cell. When you select a merged cell, JAWS announces the range of the cells included in the merger. For example, if you merge cells A1, B1, and C1, JAWS says, "A1 through C1" when you select the cell.

Track Changes in Word

JAWS can detect and announce any insertions, deletions, formatting changes, or comments made to a document using Word’s Track Changes feature. Other associated tracking functionality includes accepting or rejecting changes, displaying a list of revisions, and moving the cursor to the selected revision. See Track Changes with Braille to configure JAWS and Word to view change revisions when using braille.

Track Changes Revision Announcement

With the Track Changes option, JAWS informs you of revisions found throughout your documents. You have several choices of how to hear the revisions. Press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings, and then use first letter navigation or your arrow keys to move to the Track Changes option. Use the SPACEBAR to move through the different settings.

Several choices are available for this option.

·         Do not detect revisions. The option is turned off.

·         Speak revision type. JAWS announces the type of revision made, for example, inserted text or deleted text.

·         Speak revision type plus count. JAWS also announces the revision’s placement in the document. For example, if this is the third revision, JAWS says third.

When JAWS alerts you that the cursor is in a revision, you can press INSERT+TAB to hear additional details about the revised text.

Accept or Reject Revisions

JAWS automatically reads each revision in context as you move to it in the document or in the FootNote and Comments panes. Press ALT+R, A to open the Accept split button for revision options. Press ALT+R, J to open the Reject split button for revision options.

Revisions

Press INSERT+SHIFT+R to display a list of revisions in the current document pane. For example, pressing INSERT+SHIFT+R while focused in the main document lists revisions in the document but not in footnotes, endnots, or comments. To list revisions in footnotes, endnotes, or comments, move focus to the appropriate section and press INSERT+SHIFT+R to display revisions in that section. Once the list is displayed, select the revision you want, and press ENTER to move the insertion point to the selected revision.

Note: If the document contains a lot of revisions, JAWS plays a sound every few seconds as the list is being built. After 30 seconds, if all revisions have not yet been found, JAWS plays a different tone, and the list is displayed with all revisions found so far.

Track Changes in Virtual Viewer

To view a list of revisions in the current document pane, do the following:

1.    Press CTRL+SHIFT+E to toggle on Track Changes.

2.    Press WINDOWS Key+SEMICOLON. The Items to Display in Virtual Viewer dialog box opens.

3.    Select Revisions from the list and press ENTER.
 JAWS searches the document pane for revisions and shows the results in a Virtual Viewer window.

Note: If the document contains a lot of revisions, JAWS plays a sound every few seconds as the list is being built. After 30 seconds, if all revisions have not yet been found, JAWS plays a different tone, and all revisions found so far are displayed in the Virtual Viewer.

Note: You can also use the Items to Display in Virtual Viewer dialog box to view a list of comments, endnotes, or footnotes in the document. When viewing these items, it is not necessary to first turn on Track Changes.

Track Changes with Braille

Word’s revision tracking feature with braille works for any refreshable braille display that supports Flash messages. If the current braille line contains any revisions, they will be highlighted using dots 7 and 8. You can then press a Cursor Router twice quickly anywhere in the highlighted text to display a flash message containing additional details about the revision.

When the PC Cursor is in revised text and Word is configured to show all markup, the letters I and R display in the third and fourth status cells to indicate an insertion. The letters D and R in the third and fourth status cells indicate a deletion. If only the letter R appears, the Flash message indicates a revision such as a style or attribute change. Pressing the Cursor Routing button above the letter R for any revision will show the revision type, author, and date. When you move away from the text, the status cells no longer display revision information.

If Word is configured to show simple markup, only the letter r is shown in the fourth status cell to indicate revised text on the current line. Pressing the Cursor Router above the letter r will show the date and author of the revision.

To take advantage of using Track Changes with braille, make sure to use the Final Showing Markup or Original Showing Markup display settings in Word.

Miscellaneous Word Helpful Hints

If your standard and formatting toolbars share one row, and you go to the more buttons button, then select the button for Insert Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet, when you press ESC to leave this item, JAWS will not report your current focus. Use INSERT+UP ARROW to confirm focus.

When using larger font sizes, JAWS may inconsistently report information at the insertion point. To correct this, adjust the zoom settings under the View tab to 75% or 50%.

Listing Headings

You can press INSERT+F6 to display a list of all headings in the current document. Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to select a heading and then press ENTER to move to that heading's location in the document.

Accessing MathType Content

You can read and study math problems in Office 365 Word documents created using the MathType software from Design Science. To use this feature, you must do the following:

·         Make sure you are running the April 2019 release or later of JAWS or Fusion along with Microsoft Word from Office 365.

·         Install MathType from Wiris.com and activate the software as a trial or actual license.

·         In Settings Center, make sure the "Use Accessibility Driver for Screen Capture" check box is selected.

When you encounter a math equation or formula in a document, JAWS reads the problem and then says "Math Content." You can then press INSERT+SPACEBAR followed by EQUALS to open the JAWS Math Viewer so you can study the equation in greater detail.

Once the Math Viewer is opened, you can navigate individual parts of an equation like variables, terms, coefficients, exponents, etc. As you navigate to the various components, pressing DOWN ARROW will let you drill down into and navigate within that level of the equation using LEFT and RIGHT ARROW. Pressing UP ARROW will move you back to the prior level. In addition, if you have a Braille display and JAWS is set to United States English or Unified English Braille Grade 1 or Grade 2, the math equation or formula will be displayed in Nemeth Braille. Pressing ESC will close the Math Viewer and return to the document.

See our MathType Sample Demonstration document for examples of how JAWS and Fusion can enable students to access math content.

Visit the Design Science website for more details about MathType.

Easily Apply Autotext Entries

JAWS provides easy access to Word Autotext entries. Autotext entries are commonly used words and phrases stored in Word. When you type the first few characters of an entry, Word displays a screen tip containing the entire matching Autotext entry. Pressing ENTER inserts the word or phrase into your document.

JAWS can be set to announce these Autotext screen tips so you can take full advantage of the Word Autotext feature. To turn on screen tip announcement, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center while working in Word and expand the Speech Verbosity group.

2.    Select and expand the Configure Verbosity Levels group, and then select the appropriate verbosity level.

3.    In the Preferences dialog box, select the Tool Tip check box.

4.    Close the dialog box, and save the change in Settings Center.

To verify operation, return to Word, type the first four characters of one of the months, such as "Augu" and JAWS will announce, "August." Press ENTER and the entire month name is inserted into your document.

More Feedback with Word Commands

JAWS provides feedback when you use Word keyboard commands to change formatting. For example, when you press CTRL+SHIFT+COMMA or CTRL+SHIFT+PERIOD to decrease or increase the font point size, JAWS announces the new point size. When you press CTRL+LEFT or RIGHT BRACKET to decrease or increase the font size by one point, JAWS also announces the new point size.

Word Capitalization Toggle

JAWS provides feedback when you use the Word SHIFT+F3 command to toggle capitalization of selected text between lower case, initial cap, title cap, and all uppercase. Each time the command is pressed, JAWS spells the selected text.

Position Information

Position Information is a verbosity preference item. It can be set in Settings Center using Configure Verbosity Levels in the Speech Verbosity group. At the Advanced level it is typically turned off. For Word this setting is turned on. Position Information is useful when working in tables. It identifies when the cursor moves to a new row or column. To turn this feature off, do the following:

1.    Open Settings Center while working in Word and expand the Speech Verbosity group.

2.    Select and expand the Configure Verbosity Levels group, and then select the appropriate verbosity level.

3.    In the Preferences dialog box, clear the Position Information check box.

4.    Close the dialog box, and save the change in Settings Center.

Word and Document Views

JAWS announces the current document view in Microsoft Word. JAWS may provide slightly different information in some views, and provides additional functionality in Outline view, so it helps to know which is the current view. To switch the document view, press ALT+W, move to the view you want to use, and press ENTER.

Protected Word Documents

JAWS provides support for protected Word documents, based on the level of protection applied.

If the document protection is allow revision only, all JAWS features are available.

If the document protection is allow comments only, you can read by word, sentence, or paragraph. The JAWS settings: Language, Title Reading, Set Title Row, Set Title Column, and Clear Title Definition are not available and do not appear in the JAWS Quick Settings dialog box. The Tables option, which allows the detection of tables, is still available and functional. The contents of the current table cell, along with column and row coordinates are spoken when navigating a table.

When form field protection is applied, the only navigable portion of the document is that portion which can be edited or is unprotected--the fields to be completed.

Templates

Templates allow for easier creation of documents with specific formats, such as faxes or letters. Some templates consist of several fields. For example, a letter template may have a return address field, a date field, a send to address field, and a body field.

To move between these fields, press F11 and SHIFT+F11. These commands are similar to TAB and SHIFT+TAB. However, some templates contain text between fields which may give useful instructions. To read this text, use the arrow keys to explore the entire template before filling out the fields.

Information Messages

Some Word dialog box options have an information message associated with them. If an option has an information message, a small information balloon icon appears next to it. Use TAB or SHIFT+TAB to select the information balloon and hear its title. To read the message, press SPACEBAR.

Other Features:

List Hyperlinks

To list all hyperlinks in the current document and navigate to the selected target document, press INSERT+F7.

Enhanced Format Information

In addition to the document font and point size, INSERT+F gives you extra information about the formatting of the text at the cursor. Learn both character and paragraph level format attributes such as bold, italic, and underline. Other information includes line spacing, list information, indent levels, and font color if different from the default. Pressing INSERT+F twice quickly displays this information in the JAWS Virtual Viewer. You can also use INSERT+5 for font color information.

Note: If you select text and press INSERT+F, JAWS may report "mixed font," or "Mixed point size." This indicates that the selected text includes text with different fonts or point sizes.

Switch Document Panes:

When you use the Word keystrokes F6 or SHIFT+F6 to switch document panes, JAWS alerts you to which pane you are switching.

Selection Mode:

F8 is used to turn Extended Selection mode on. Subsequent presses of F8 select the current word, sentence, paragraph and document. JAWS announces the unit being selected and the text of that unit. Other navigational keys can also be used to extend the selection. Use ESC to exit Extended Selection Mode.

Screen Sensitive Help in Word

Screen Sensitive Help (INSERT+F1) gives you information about your document, including the number of tables, the number of fields, and the document protection type. Screen Sensitive Help tells you about the Header/Footer pane, the Footnote/Endnote pane, the Comments pane, page number locations, multiple text columns and margin settings. Also, the document summary is spoken after information about the current cell or form field. When Form fields have the focus, INSERT+F1 gives Screen Sensitive Help appropriate to the Form field. Screen Sensitive Help reports the number of objects in the drawing and text layers, then tells you how to convert objects to text layer objects so JAWS can detect them. JAWS also now announces the width and height in points of the current table cell. Screen Sensitive Help alerts the user if Extended Selection Mode is on.

Word Spelling and Grammar Error Detection

JAWS can automatically detect and report spelling and grammatical errors and even tell you how many errors are on the current line. You can also bring up a list of the spelling or grammatical errors and move your cursor to the selected error.

By default, JAWS will:

·         Announce "misspelled" when encountering spelling errors as you navigate a document.

·         Play a sound during typing, when you press SPACEBAR after entering a misspelled word.

·         Play a sound to indicate when a word is corrected.

·         Underline spelling errors in braille.

To configure how JAWS indicates spelling and grammatical errors, open Settings Center (INSERT+6 on the number row), expand Text Processing in the tree view, and expand the Proofing group.

To turn off the announcement of misspelled words, or if you would rather hear a sound when encountering spelling errors, change the "Detect Spelling While Navigating" option. You can also clear the "Detect Spelling While Typing" check box if you do not want to be alerted to spelling errors when you press the SPACEBAR or when an error is corrected.

If "Grammar and Advanced Proofing" is selected, JAWS tells you when you move into and out of text marked as a grammatical error. You can also choose to have grammatical and advanced proofing errors underlined in braille along with spelling errors.

When either spelling or grammar detection is enabled, and the options to speak spelling error or grammar/proofing error count are selected, arrowing onto a line or pressing the Say Line command (INSERT+UP ARROW) on a line with errors speaks the number of errors followed by the line.

Listing Spelling and Grammar Errors

To list all spelling errors, press ALT+SHIFT+L. Select an error in the list and press ENTER to move the insertion point to the selected error in your document. To list all grammatical errors, press INSERT+SHIFT+G. Select an error in the list and press ENTER to move the insertion point to the selected error in your document.

Using Spell Check

When you press F7 to open the spellchecker, you are presented with options to review all, only spelling errors, grammar errors, refinements, or open Word’s Proofing settings. When an error is found or you move to the next error after selecting an option, focus is now placed into a read-only edit field that displays the sentence containing the error. You can also press INSERT+C from anywhere in this pane to have JAWS read the misspelled word as it appears in the document.

Additionally, suggestions are displayed as split buttons instead of in a list. When an error is found, JAWS still announces and spells the first suggestion, but you must now TAB to the suggestion you want to use and press ENTER to accept it. Pressing INSERT+F7 also reads the current suggestion. Pressing ALT+DOWN ARROW on the selected split button for a suggestion displays extra options for the current suggestion including Read Aloud, Spell Out, Change All, and Add to AutoCorrect. Note that Change All may not be available for all split buttons. To access additional options such as Ignore, use the Other Actions group.

Note: If the spellchecker in your version of Office still displays suggestions as a list instead of split buttons, you are not yet running a version containing the latest Microsoft changes.

Tables in Word

JAWS detects when you move into, out of, and within a table (from row to row or column to column) and even warns you when you TAB into the last cell. JAWS also indicates when the number of columns changes from one row to another. Table detection includes nested tables.

Press CTRL+INSERT+T to list all tables in the document. The list shows each table and its dimensions. Select the table you want, and press ENTER to move to it. The insertion point is placed in the first cell of the table, or in the first form field in the table if the document is protected.

Reading Tables

In Word, once in a table, press TAB to move to the next cell, and press SHIFT+TAB to move to the prior cell. The JAWS standard commands for reading tables are also supported. Refer to Using JAWS to Navigate Tables.

To read a table row, press ALT+WINDOWS Key+COMMA or ALT+WINDOW Key+NUM PAD 5. To read a table column, press ALT+WINDOWS Key+PERIOD. To toggle revision detection on or off in a table, press INSERT+ALT+R.

Column and Row Titles

JAWS can be set to automatically announce the title of columns and/or rows as you move through tables. To configure row and/or column title reading:

1.    Move to the column or row that contains the titles. If you are setting both column and row titles, move to the cell where the column and row containing the titles intersect.

2.    Press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings.

3.    Move to Row Titles Column Set to specify row titles are within the current column. Move to Column Titles Row Set to specify that column titles are within the current row.

4.    Press ENTER to close the dialog.

To read a column title, press ALT+INSERT+SHIFT+C and to read a row title, press ALT+INSERT+SHIFT+R. To reset the row and column title definitions, open Quick Settings, move to Title Definitions Clear, and press SPACEBAR.

Non Uniform Tables

Non uniform tables are tables with rows that span more than one column, or columns that span more than one row. JAWS can provide detailed information about the table that can help you navigate and get oriented. If you do not want to hear this information, press INSERT+V, select "Table Description," and press the SPACEBAR to choose "Off." This setting is retained even after you quit Word.

While Table Description is on, JAWS informs you when you move into a non-uniform table. You can then press INSERT+F1 to learn more about the table. If the table contains merged columns, JAWS says, "At least one cell in this table spans more than one column." If the table contains merged rows, JAWS says, "At least one cell in this table spans more than one row."

Tables with Merged Columns

If a table has merged cells that span one or more columns and Table Description is on, JAWS announces when the number of columns changes as you move from row to row with ALT+CTRL+UP or DOWN ARROW. For example, in a table with eight columns, if you move from a regular cell to a cell that spans five columns, JAWS says, "Number of columns changed from eight to four."

If you set a row to be used for column headers that contains a non uniform number of cells, JAWS cannot properly associate the column headers. For example, if you have a table with eight columns, but the first row contains only four cells, and you assign that row for column headers, JAWS does not read the column headers, but only states the position within the table.

If the first or last rows contain differing numbers of cells from the other rows in a table, it may not be possible for JAWS to identify the top or bottom of a column. In this case, if you use the commands to move to the top or bottom of a column, ALT+CTRL+SHIFT+UP ARROW and ALT+CTRL+SHIFT+DOWN ARROW, JAWS announces that the move cannot be made, and the insertion point is not moved.

Tables with Merged Rows

A table may have columns that span multiple rows. JAWS does not indicate when you have moved from a regular cell into a cell that spans multiple rows. In addition, you cannot use ALT+CTRL+UP or DOWN ARROW to navigate a table with merged rows. If the table also has both merged rows and merged columns, you may not be able to use ALT+CTRL+RIGHT or LEFT ARROW to navigate the table either. Instead, use TAB and SHIFT+TAB to move through the table cells.

Word Tables in Braille

JAWS allows you to determine how much information is displayed on your refreshable braille display for tables in Word documents when you are using Structured Mode. You can choose to display the current cell, current row, or current column. By default, only the current cell is displayed as you navigate a table.

To change how tables are displayed in braille, do the following:

1.    Press INSERT+V to open Quick Settings.

2.    In the Search edit field, type "table display", then press DOWN ARROW to move into the list of search results.

3.    Navigate to the Table Display option and press the SPACEBAR to cycle through the available options.

4.    Select OK to close the dialog box.

If JAWS is configured to display either the current row or current column, the vertical bar symbol (dots 1-2-5-6) will be displayed between cells to help indicate where one cell ends and the next begins.

If the current row is being displayed, JAWS will display the current column number before the cell where the cursor is located. In addition, if JAWS is configured to speak column headers, the header for the current column will also be shown in braille following the column number and prior to the cell containing the cursor.

Similarly, If the current column is being displayed, JAWS will display the current row number before the cell where the cursor is located. In addition, if JAWS is configured to speak row headers, the header for the current row will also be shown in braille following the row number and prior to the cell containing the cursor.

Creating Accessible Tables

You can create accessible tables for JAWS using functionality available in Microsoft Word. This means that even those who do not use JAWS can mark table row and column headings for JAWS users.

To make a table accessible, start Microsoft Word and open the document containing your table(s). If the table has both row and column headings, place the insertion point in a cell where the row and column containing the headings meet. Then, open the Insert menu and choose Bookmark. Type "Title" and press ENTER.

If the table has only row headings, place the insertion point in any cell within the column containing the headings. Then, open the Insert menu and choose Bookmark. Type "RowTitle" and press ENTER.

If the table has only column headings, place the insertion point in any cell within the row containing the headings. Then, open the Insert menu and choose Bookmark. Type "ColumnTitle" and press ENTER.

Tip: Do not place a bookmark in each cell that contains a heading. JAWS recognizes all cells in the marked row or column as a heading.

 

Microsoft Word does not allow two bookmarks to use the same name. If there is more than one table in your document, add a number or descriptive word to the end of the bookmark text used to indicate headings. For example, "Title_1," "RowTitle_Revenue," or "ColumnTitle_Expenses."

Any JAWS user can override the information provided by the document author. To do this, press INSERT+V while you are in Word to open Quick Settings. Select "Defined Bookmark Table Column and Row Titles Override" and use the SPACEBAR to cycle through the available options. Choose "On for the current file" to override named titles for tables in the currently open document. Choose "On for all files" to override named titles in all documents that you open in Word. If you want to use the table information provided by the author again, choose "Off."

Outline View In Word

Word's Outline View makes it easy to view and reorganize large documents. Outline View is most effective When a document is structured logically, using headings hierarchically. Headings are used as titles of sections and subsections of documents. Outline View lets you display only the headings in your document, and to select the heading levels that are displayed. For example, in Outline View, press ALT+SHIFT+3 to display all headings at levels 3, 2, and 1.

To switch to Outline View in Word, press ALT+W to open the View tab, and choose Outline.

Show Headings at Level

To display headings to a specific level, press ALT+SHIFT plus the number, 1 through 7, of the heading level you want to display. Once you have located the heading you need, press ALT+SHIFT+A to display all headings and all text in the document.

This is a great way to move through your document. Just select to display headings to the level you need, move to the heading for the section you need to edit, then press ALT+SHIFT+A to switch back to displaying all headings and the text of the document sections. After making changes, switch back to viewing only the headings you need, and move to the next section you wish to edit.

Restructuring and Reorganizing in Outline View

Outline View makes it easy to view the document structure as a whole, restructure it, and reorganize it.

The document structure displayed in Outline View is based on Word paragraph styles, set under Format, Styles, or set with Word shortcut keys. Refer to Word help for more information on Word styles.

Press ALT+SHIFT+LEFT ARROW to change to the prior heading level. Press ALT+SHIFT+RIGHT ARROW to change to the next heading level. What you are changing is the style assigned to the text of your section or subsection title. For example, if the insertion point is on text that uses the style Heading 3, and you press ALT+SHIFT+LEFT ARROW the style is changed to Heading 2.

Tip: These commands also work to switch text to prior and next heading styles when in other Views.

 

It is very easy to reorganize your document while in Outline View. Select to display only the headings to the level you need, move to the heading for the section or subsection you wish to move, then press ALT+SHIFT+UP ARROW to move the heading up in the document, or press ALT+SHIFT+DOWN ARROW to move the heading down in the document.

The section of the document is moved, along with any text and subsections. For example, if you have a document with three sections at heading level 2, and under each of these sections there are five subsections at heading level 3, if you press ALT+SHIFT+2 to display headings to level 2, move to the third heading at level 2, and then press ALT+SHIFT+UP ARROW, that heading becomes the second section, and the 5 subsections at heading level 3 that were under that section are still there, in the second part of the document instead of the third.

When you move headings and the sections contained within them in this manner, the heading is selected in Word while it is moved. You may need to press LEFT ARROW or RIGHT ARROW to deselect the heading before moving to the next or previous line with UP or DOWN ARROW.

Note: The ALT+SHIFT plus arrow key combinations perform their expected JAWS function of moving the cursor by the global mouse pixel setting if the PC Cursor is not active).

 

For a listing of the keyboard commands for working in Outline View, refer to Commands for using Outline View.

Protected Word Forms

A form is a structured document with fields reserved for entering information. When a document has its Protection Status set to “Allow only form fields,” navigation is restricted to each field. Protecting a form allows you to fill in the form, but prevents you from changing the form's layout and its elements. Form fields in Microsoft Word include edit boxes, check boxes, and combo boxes.

With certain guidelines followed, JAWS can read protected forms in Microsoft Word. For an in-depth tutorial, see Creating Accessible Forms in Microsoft Word on the Freedom Scientific Accessibility and Usability Web page.

Within protected forms, JAWS reads form field text labels that use prompt terminators (i.e. colon or question mark), default form field values, and form field help text. Text labels and help text are descriptive text that tells you what response is expected in the corresponding field. Default values are often assigned to form fields to provide this same information. Any text not associated with a field can be read using the JAWS or Invisible cursor.

Tip: If no label is associated with the field or you would like to assign the field a different label, you can create a custom label for the field.

Navigating Forms

Use TAB to navigate through a form. Generally, TAB moves left to right, unless you are in a table cell with multiple fields in it. In this case, pressing TAB moves down the cell, then moves right to the next cell. Press SHIFT+TAB to move through the form fields in reverse order.

Press CTRL+INSERT+HOME to move to the first field in a form. Press ALT+SHIFT+F to list all form fields in the document.

Press SPACEBAR to check or clear a check box. Press ENTER to open a combo box, use the ARROW keys to navigate the menu, and then press ENTER again to make your selection.

Creating Custom Labels

You can assign a custom label to any form field in a Word document. JAWS announces this label when you move to or read the form field. The custom label replaces the label assigned to the form field by the author (if any). To assign a custom label to an element or change a custom label already assigned to an element, do the following:

1.    Use the TAB key to move to the form field you want to label.

2.    Press INSERT+F2, select "Custom Label," and press ENTER.

Tip: You can also press CTRL+INSERT+TAB to create a custom label for the form field.

3.    Type the text you want to use for the label and press ENTER.

JAWS saves custom labels saved in the document's .jsi file in the Settings\Enu\Personalized Settings folder. These labels are available each time you access the document.

If you want to hear the original labels for form fields in your document, you can temporarily hide your custom labels. Press INSERT+V, select "Use Custom Labels," and press the SPACEBAR to choose "Off." The next time you move to a form field with a custom label, JAWS reads the original label instead (if one is available).

To permanently delete a custom label, move to the form field with the label you want to delete and press INSERT+F2. Select "Custom Label Delete" and press ENTER to delete the label. If you want to delete all custom labels in the document, press INSERT+F2, select "Custom Label Delete All" and press ENTER.

Language Detection in Word

As you navigate or read text in a document containing multiple languages, JAWS attempts to switch synthesizer languages automatically. This functionality is available with Eloquence, Vocalizer Expressive, or SAPI5 synthesizers, as long as the following three conditions are true:

·         The synthesizer in use supports the required language

·         Appropriate language-specific voices are installed

·         In Microsoft Word, the text has been properly marked to indicate the language in use

If your speech synthesizer does not support the language in use, JAWS will continue using the voice and language as specified in your current profile, and will also alert you to the language prior to speaking the respective text.

Language detection and switching is honored by all speech functions, except text selection and backspacing. Language switching will not work if you use the JAWS Cursor.

It is recommended that you have all Word language modules that you intend to use installed before using this feature. In order for the text to be marked correctly, we recommend that you install and use language-specific keyboard layouts. For example, installing a German keyboard layout under Regional and Language Options, and then switching to this keyboard layout whenever you wish to write in German, will mark the text appropriately in Microsoft Word. For English, be sure to switch back to your English keyboard language. This also applies to composing messages in Outlook since Outlook uses Microsoft Word as its default message editor.

To set text language manually in Microsoft Word, do the following:

1.    Select text of a specific language in the document.

2.    On the Review tab, select Language and then Set Proofing Language.

3.    Select the correct language and then select the Detect Language Automatically check box.

4.    You can also select the check box that says Do not check spelling or grammar.

5.    Select the OK button.

6.    Repeat these steps for each section of text in a different language from the default document language.

The language detection option within Quick Settings is on by default. To disable this option, Press INSERT+V, move to Language Detect Change, and press SPACEBAR.

Note: All languages supported by the Eloquence software synthesizer are installed by default.
 
 To download additional Vocalizer Expressive languages, use the Add/Remove Voices utility located in the JAWS application window under Options and Voices.

Creating Accessible Forms in Word

This topic provides a very basic overview of accessible form design. For an in-depth tutorial, see Creating Accessible Forms in Microsoft Word on the Freedom Scientific Accessibility and Usability Web page.

Accessible Form Design

You can develop easy-to-use forms in Microsoft Word. In general, a simple form design is the best guideline for successful reading of protected forms. When designing the lay out, consider the information with regard to the flow of your form. A simple form arranges information either vertically or horizontally, whereas a complex form arranges information both horizontally and vertically and frequently uses tables. Use fonts that JAWS can read easily. Typically this means san serif fonts between 8 and 32 points.
